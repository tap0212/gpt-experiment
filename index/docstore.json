When I received his invitation I had just\nfinished reviewing The Wine Grape Production Guide for Eastern\nNorth America (2008) edited by Doctor Tony Wolf of Virginia\nTech. In that review I stated how well served the Eastern States of\nthe USA were in their viticulture endeavors by that book. And now,\nhot on the heels is Mark Chien\u201fs Practical Guide to Developing a\nCommercial Wine Vineyard. The grape growers of Eastern USA are\ndoubly blessed.\nAs Mark says his book should be seen as a compliment to\nthat mentioned above. And I believe it is. Mark has written a very\ndown-to-earth and practical book which should be on the bookshelf,\nand more importantly in the mind, of anyone planning a vineyard\ninvestment in the Eastern USA.\nI have worked with Mark on several occasions and always\nenjoyed his commitment to his growers and to the Pennsylvania wine sector. He is a charming person,\nand very dedicated. His frank and forward style of speaking about viticulture is evident in this book, I\ncan almost hear him speaking as I read it.\nThe scope of the book is excellent for beginners in viticulture. There are 21 chapters covering the\ntechnology and psychology and sociology of vineyard development. I like Mark\u201fs emphasis on\ncontinuing education. A grower who is not always trying to learn is not prepared to make his or her\nvineyard as good as it can be.\nMark\u201fs book covers the most important aspects of vineyard development from a reality check\nabout why you want to do it, the harsh truths of vineyard economics, the great importance of site selection\n(I tell my audience this is more important than spouse selection!) Almost as important is what to plant,\nand how you will trellis and manage your vineyard.\nThis book is not written as an academic text. Mark is flooded with enquiries from people perhaps\njust like yourself who are tempted to set out in the business of grape growing in the Eastern USA. You\nshare those aspirations with Thomas Jefferson, but are more likely to succeed because we know now so\nmuch more about it than when Jefferson made his first attempts. The eastern USA is not an easy place to\ngrow wine grapes but the rewards in terms of wine quality can be substantial. And, add to that, you live\namong one of the most important and affluent wine markets in the world.\nI hope Mark\u201fs book is a bestseller.

And yet the vineyard was plagued with all sorts of\nproblems, including poor soil drainage, and dubious variety, rootstock and trellis choice. I\nasked Lucie whether it would help if they brought her in now, after the design and development\nphase, and her response in a nutshell was: No, it\u2019s too late - so many of the critical decisions\nthat impact wine quality have already been made and many of them were wrong, and it would be\ntoo difficult or expensive or both, to correct them mid-stream.\nHow could a smart owner spend tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars developing a\nvineyard and yet do it wrong? Sadly, it happens all too often. Vineyards are a long-term\nendeavor and the quality of the wine is determined largely by the quality of the grapes. The preplant decisions are the most important ones to the success of the entire enterprise. Every project\nbegins with a knowledge gap \u2013 inherently with regard to the site itself, and almost always for\nthose intending to plant the vineyard. It is up to the owner to figure out how to fill that void. The\nbeginning is precisely the time to seek expert advice and build a knowledge base that will\ndetermine the quality of the wine, from the first bottle to the one made 25 years from now.\nEven with the most rigorous research and preparation, however, there are plenty of\nupfront unknowns. Will anyone buy the wine? Will the critics praise it? Will you be able to\nrecoup your investment? Your success depends on what you decide to do now. Vineyards are\nsensitive and complex living organisms where little things may make a big difference and you\ncan never pay too much attention to detail. They are also business enterprises that require skill\nin bookkeeping and marketing. Our society underestimates and lacks appreciation for the\ntenacity, skill, and passion of the farmer. You will have to bring multiple skill sets to bear on a\nvineyard to have any hope of succeeding. While much about the grapevine is not yet understood,\nwhat we do know must be exploited to the fullest extent possible, especially when dealing with\nthe difficult climate conditions of eastern North America. Give yourself plenty of time therefore\nto navigate the planning and development process. This will pay large dividends in the short and\nlong term, and in what ends up in the glass.\nThis manual is a compendium of what I have learned over twenty years as a wine grower\nand ten as a viticulture extension educator. In my experience the most creative and innovative\npractitioners push quality further and faster than the best efforts of scientists to improve or\nexplain viticultural results in field.

I thank Helmut and Margot\nRingsdorf, and Heinz-Wilhelm Dongess and Ulla Brunn for getting me in touch with the\nromance of wine and vineyards. When I look back, over three decades of adventures in\nwinegrowing, I have been blessed and informed by a remarkably diverse, generous, interesting\nand fun group of people. This book tries to summarize what I have learned from them. Every\nday I encounter more people who love wine and want to grow it so I try to use what I have\nlearned to help them to help others.\nSo many people have inspired me over the years but I think of great wine growers from\nChristian Mouiex at Chateau Petrus, Jeff Newton in Santa Barbara, Ted Casteel in Oregon, Jim\nLaw in Virginia and so many others who helped me to connect the dots between the elements\nand the wine. Richard Smart has probably done more to improve wine quality around the world\nthan any other individual. He is always an inspiration to wine growers.\nThis manual could not have been written without the help of many people. Lucie\nMorton, Steve Mudd, Jeff Newton, Nelson Stewart, and Rutger de Vink submitted to lengthy\ninterviews to make sure this manual was relevant. 43 wine growers and extension educators\nhelped by filling out the vineyard manual survey. Ed Boyce, Kevin Ker, Jim Law, Dr. Tim\nMartinson, and Mike Walsh were so gracious to agree to review the book when asked just as the\n2009 vintage got underway. For me one of the best features of the manual are its sidebar\ncontribution from an amazing who\u201fs who list of significant contributors to wine in America.\nTheir words help to connect the contents to reality.\nI am very grateful to my sister, Lisa, who graciously offered her time and talent to edit\nand review the manual.\nA project like this is one part passion and five parts frustration and dogged determination.\nI cannot ever thank my best friend and cheerleader, Judi, for her patience and encouragement as I\nslogged my way through this process, and her outstanding editing skills.\n7\nIntroduction\nAuthor\u201fs note: This manual is a guide to wine growing in the non-arid, continental climate\nconditions that are typical of the states east of the Rocky Mountains, where winter injury and\nsummer rainfall form part of the reality of growing grapes.

I will refer to this extensive region\nas the \u201cEast,\u201d but for practical purposes it means the region of the United States east of the\nRockies and other wine growing areas with a similar climate.\nWe are witnessing a period of rapid vineyard\nexpansion driven largely by wine enthusiasts with\nsufficient discretionary income to plant a vineyard.\nIn many cases these are white collar professionals\nwith no experience growing anything besides their\nown house plants or backyard gardens. How, then,\ndo they make the leap from a garden to a\ncommercial vineyard? As a viticulture extension\neducator for the state of Pennsylvania, I have\nwritten this manual in response to the very real need\nfor a practical guide to developing a commercial\nwine vineyard. The recommendations contained\nhere are based on my personal experience as a wine grower on Long Island and in Oregon, but\nare also informed by ten years spent working with wine growers and learning from their\ntriumphs and their mistakes in the East as an extension educator.\nThe quality of the vineyards in the East has vastly improved following an international\ntrend towards better wines, facilitated by the development of new knowledge and technologies,\nsuch as precision site evaluation, novel varieties, clones, rootstocks, trellis and training systems,\nvineyard design, viticulture practices, etc. One of the main purposes of this book is to help you\nlearn from, and hopefully avoid, the mistakes that plague most new vineyards. If you can do this\nyou will have better grapes (and wine), earlier profitability, and experience less frustration,\nwasted time and expense.\nIt is important to remember that producing wine is all about agriculture. America used to\nbe an agrarian society where most families lived by growing their food. While wine is not\nconsidered to be a basic staple in the United States, if you decide to go into wine growing you\nwill become part of the agriculture community, joining the less than two percent of Americans\nstill involved in food production. If you make this commitment, it should include the\ndetermination to produce a high-quality product using sustainable best practices in a close\npartnership with the land.\nThis book is first and foremost a practical guide to growing wine grapes (to be\ndistinguished from table and raisin grapes, or fruit that will be processed into juice or jelly), and\nit will tell you how to do so as a commercial business, i.e. grapes for sale to a bonded winery that\nmakes and sells wine. Targeted at serious wine growers who will shape the reputation of Eastern\nwines, it attempts to explain how to turn an idea into a high-quality wine grape vineyard,\noutlining the sequence of steps involved in planning, designing, preparing, and planting a\nvineyard, and then nurturing it through its first years. Each phase has specific requirements that\ndemand careful attention to detail if you want to achieve a profitable and sustainable vineyard.\nKaramoor Farm Vineyard\n8\nThis manual does not pretend to be an academic textbook.

Much of the information it\ncontains is anecdotal, firmly based on an empirical approach to viticulture. The fact is that in\nthis field almost every idea or practice is still open to debate. While there is a great deal of\nscience to support standard viticultural activities, there is just as much that we do not understand\nabout the vine and how to cultivate it. This is why successful viticulture requires a broad\napproach to knowledge acquisition, learning from trial and error, listening to other growers\u201f\nexperiences and to one\u201fs own intuition, and drawing on sources from the Old World and the New\nthat may be applicable to our local conditions.\nFor this reason, the manual contains practical advice that may not be easily found\nelsewhere. However, to fill in any possible gaps, a carefully selected list of reference resources\nis provided. There are many excellent production guides available, and you can also Google key\nwords to pull up a wealth of information. The perfect complement to this manual is The Wine\nGrape Production Guide for Eastern North America (2008), edited by Dr. Tony Wolf, and I\nstrongly recommend that anyone beginning a vineyard development project use these two\nresources in tandem.\nGrowers prefer above all to learn from other growers. As a check on the contents of this\nmanual, a survey was conducted among fifty leading wine growers, viticulture consultants and\nresearchers in the Eastern wine industry. They have provided many valuable insights based on\ntheir personal experience. Extensive interviews with some of the most progressive and\nsuccessful growers and consultants working in the region have, I believe, added a greater depth\nof experience to this work. For the convenience of the reader, their input on some especially\nimportant topics is presented in the form of sidebars. Finally, five of my most trusted and\nrespected viticulture friends have reviewed this manual and their fingerprints are all of this work.\nThe goal of this manual is to contribute to the establishment of a regional wine culture in\nall wine categories that will earn international respect and recognition. This is an exciting time\nto be a part of the Eastern wine industry and you will be one of its pioneers.\n9\nChapter 1\nA Great Tradition and Your Personal \u201cAh-Ha\u201d Moment\nWine has been around for a long time. Before water was safe to drink, beverages like\nwine and beer helped to sustain mankind. Dr. Patrick McGovern, an archeochemist at the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania observed, with reference to the symposia of ancient Greece, that\nwine was a beverage that \u201cgreased the skids\u201d of Western civilization. Beginning with the\nhawthorne berries that were used to make a fermented drink nine thousand years ago in China,\nand continuing with the cultivation of grapes by the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans, wine has\nformed an integral part of the culinary, religious, and social history of man. We have evidence\nthat the ancient Egyptians practiced viticulture, and the Greeks conducted a brisk industry and\ntrade in wine. The Romans pushed the grape into France and Germany, thereby planting the\nseeds of the tradition that is so venerated today. Despite this long history, the fundamentals of\nwinemaking and the plant itself have not changed; wine is still fermented by yeast using grapes\nof the same botanical origin as those that existed millennia ago. Wine and other alcoholic\nproducts always accompanied territorial expansion. We know that William Penn brought vines\nwith him when he arrived in the New World in 1684.\nWe now live in a global age of viticulture and enology, extending from Italy, France and\nGermany in the Old World to new regions such as Australia, South America, the United States\nand others, all employing and", "doc_id": "d96079fd-2086-4ded-8243-90ce0052cf83", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "2e66f823fc7217b331da731387ac3ab077cfe8e0eff211594ebd930e51da7ba1", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 15369, "end": 19471}, "relationships": {"1": "acd3b8f9-6274-4b01-8706-eb3b89775b72", "2": "e9e0a7df-f744-40ad-bb20-90ddd895f016", "3": "aa203c31-a9bb-4dd5-9aa8-46e23fa4a652"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "aa203c31-a9bb-4dd5-9aa8-46e23fa4a652": {"__data__": {"text": "viticulture, and the Greeks conducted a brisk industry and\ntrade in wine.

For example, vertical shoot\npositioned training has replaced many traditional systems and is now used in almost all of the\ngreat wine districts. Such shared practices and methods are just one reason why wine is so\nfascinating. We can now make direct comparisons between Cabernet Sauvignon grown on the\nleft bank in Bordeaux with that grown in Virginia or Napa Valley. Viticulture and enology\nspeak a common language, and wine growers can travel to different countries to talk shop and\nlearn something new. So while the wine industry in the East is still in its infancy, relatively\nspeaking, it has access to the same knowledge and technology that is being used in the great\nvineyards of the world.\nMost vineyards start with a love of wine, and an idea that turns into a passion, but after\nthe light bulb has been switched on \u2026 where does one start? Most people who contact the\ncooperative extension service for advice about grape growing are at the mid-point or near the end\nof their professional careers, when a vineyard and life as a gentleman farmer as a retirement\nbusiness or serious hobby looks extremely attractive. A top consultant describes his typical\nclient as \u201ceducated, wealthy, ambitious and burned-out.\u201d The timeless and irresistible allure of\nwine is understandable, but the truth to be faced is that if you have come to wine and agriculture\nlater in your life, you will have to overcome immense challenges.\nEvery vineyard is unique and yours will be your own creation. It begins with the site,\nand your task will be to get to know this site and its terroir so that you can adopt the most\nsuitable viticulture techniques to it. Terroir refers to the complex combination of soil, climate,\nplant and viticulture factors that intermingle to make a wine expressive of the place where it is\ngrown. In France and Italy the wine growers\u201f understanding of their terroir has had the\nopportunity to mature over the course of centuries, leading in some places (such as the Mosel,\nRhein, Alsace, Burgundy, Bordeaux, Piedmont, and Tuscany) to wines that are regarded as\nbenchmarks for the rest of the world.\n10\nIn the East our aim is to speed up this process, using all the tools at our disposal to\nidentify the best places to grow and make wine. Eastern wine is characterized by a diverse range\nof grape varieties. This can be both a blessing and a curse. Standard native and traditional hybrid\nvarieties such as Concord, Niagara, Marechal Foch, Baco Noir, etc., make up the core of the\nwine industry and for these varieties production practices are well understood and implemented.\nHowever, the process of developing high quality hybrid and classic European vinifera varieties is\nstill underway.\nBefore you begin, you should be aware that there is no formula for creating a successful\nvineyard. There are prescribed steps that have proved successful elsewhere, but everything must\nbe adapted to the particular conditions of your site.

You should expect information overload\nalmost immediately. If you are not good at collecting, processing, and synthesizing large\namounts of data and making educated decisions you will have trouble developing a high quality\nvineyard. There are practices shared around the world, but your site is unique and you will have\nto find the best combination of plants (varieties, rootstocks) and vineyard design (spacing,\ntrellises, etc.) and management practices to apply to it. To add to the confusion, like any\ncomputer operating system, there will always be more than one way to achieve a given result and\nyou will have to decide which one is the best for you and your site.\nAnother of the realities of grape growing is that it involves the art of compromise. A\nvineyard begins with an ideal concept in the mind or on paper and then works steadily towards\nthe closest approximation of it. Remember that there is no perfect site (although there are\ndefinitely better and worse sites), and furthermore every decision you make about one thing will\nhave an impact on dozens of others. The best approach is to view the vineyard as an aggregate\nsystem and not focus on its parts in isolation. If you do, you risk design and decision gridlock.\nA vineyard is by definition a monoculture system, and what is worse in the case of the classic\nEuropean varieties, places a non-indigenous species, Old World Vitis vinifera, smack in the\nmiddle of a number of New World enemies \u2013 diseases and pests such as phylloxera, powdery\nmildew, downy mildew, etc. that are native to the Eastern U.S. Nature prefers diversity, so\nintroduce your vineyard gently into its environment and give it time to assimilate.\nIt is important to be aggressive in the pursuit of knowledge, and decisive in its utilization.\nSeek the best and most reliable advice you can find from a multitude of sources. The result will\nbe gratifying \u2013 a wine that is unique to your vineyard. A very wise grower told me recently that\nwhen he started he didn\u201ft know what he didn\u201ft know. That is a dangerous place to be. It is\nessential to fill that knowledge gap quickly and correctly. He further explained that if he had\nhired the expert consultants he has now, he would have cut his time to fine wines in half or more.\nNOTE: A core assumption of this guide is that the reader\u2019s intention is to grow the highestquality grapes possible for a given type, style and price-point of wine.\nIf the reader does not accept this as a core value, then this manual will probably not be\nvery helpful. In the wine industry there is an oft-quoted saying that: \u201cFine wine is made in the\nvineyard.\u201d The best growers and vineyards are dedicated to this truth. Although winemakers are\nthe \u201crock stars\u201d of the wine world and growers remain in the background (doing most of the hard\nwork, it will seem), the fact remains that no outstanding wine is possible without the best fruit as\nits raw material and all great wine producers fully understand this.\n11\nA note on terroir\nThis elusive term has been embellished, marketed and politicized for the past two\ndecades in the wine world, beginning with the French who (quite understandably) use it to add\nmystique to their wines.

While difficult to describe and virtually impossible to quantify, it does\nconvey something of the complexity of growing a wine and may be useful in that sense.\nTerroir exists everywhere and not just\nfor vineyards. All artisan foods may be said\nto be a product of their terroir. A potted\nplant has its own terroir. For the purposes of\nthis manual, terroir is the combination of\ncomponents in the ecosystem of the vineyard\nthat contribute to a wine\u201fs \u201csomewhereness\u201d\n(from Matt Kramer; now there\u201fs a great\nscientific term if there ever was one). The\nFrench worship the soil above all else in\nterroir, but how can we explain the highly\npraised garagiste wines emanating from the\nlesser vineyards of Bordeaux, where small\nproducers employ extreme viticulture\nmethods to make up for site deficiencies? In\narid wine regions the tendency is to worship\nthe sun and assign the highest value to the influence of climate. In California and other arid\nregions, climate drives the definition of terroir. So this is a very malleable term depending on\none\u201fs viticultural heritage and perspective.\nIn the East, as in most emerging wine regions, viticulture is often given precedence over\nsite characteristics. However, as wine regions mature (Napa Valley, Oregon, etc.), the qualities\nof site emerge and are more fully understood and appreciated. As the subject is so difficult to\nresearch, there is little data to support hypotheses regarding terroir; for example, many wine\nconnoisseurs are convinced that the mineral, stony, chalky or slate character of a wine is a direct\nexpression of the soil, but scientific evidence only points to an indirect influence of soil on the\nflavors that appear in a wine. This is hardly an answer suitable for wine writers and their\nflowery prose, but we cannot ignore science altogether. In the end, the wine grower must rely on\nhis skill and the sensitivity of his palate to discern and then manipulate the innumerable factors\nthat go into the creation of a wine. My advice would be to try and grasp the practical\nimplications of the terroir of your vineyard, and not get bogged down in the abstract concepts or\npoetry.\nWhat makes the wine from these Cabernet Sauvignon vines in\nthe Medoc so special?\n12\nChapter 2\nThe Truth about Continental Climate Wine Growing\nThere is one thing that every prospective wine grower will eventually learn about\ngrowing grapes in the East: it poses a more complex set of challenges than almost anywhere else.\nIn fact, after ten years of experience here, I can confidently state that this may be the single most\ndifficult place in the viticultural world to grow fine wine. Serious threats to wine quality abound\nincluding winter injury, hurricanes, drought, diseases, pests, summer rain and humidity to a\ndegree of severity and intensity unknown in other wine regions. These risks would be\nconsidered unacceptable to colleagues working in more conducive conditions such as California,\nand many openly wonder why wine growing is even attempted in the East.\nWhat does this mean in practical terms? It means that you must introduce nothing less\nthan best practices in the vineyard, because if poor conditions develop it will be difficult to\nachieve acceptable results with anything less. Even so, there will be years when despite a heroic\neffort the grapes will struggle to attain even standard quality.

Even so, there will be years when despite a heroic\neffort the grapes will struggle to attain even standard quality. The truth in agriculture is that\nduring poor years farmers will expend tremendous amounts of money and effort and see only a\nmodest or poor return, whereas in good years great grapes appear with relatively little effort and\nexpense. In the East every vintage will put you to the test and if you limit your investment in\nterms of time and energy you will achieve mediocrity at best. You simply have to be a smarter\nand better wine grower than your counterpart in any arid region to achieve consistently fine\nwines.\nOne\u201fs approach to viticulture is always dictated by the growing conditions. Eastern wine\ngrowers must strive to reach two goals. First, they must shorten the vegetative cycle of the vine\nin order to get the fruit ripe as early as possible and beat the various harvest threats to quality:\nrain, rots, birds, frost, etc. Secondly, for vineyards in cold regions such as north of the MasonDixon line or in the Midwest,they have to get the wood as mature as possible to achieve\nmaximum cold hardiness during the winter to insure bud and vine survival. Fortunately, best\npractices are generally consistent with both of these objectives and everything that is done in the\nvineyard \u2013 from selecting a good site to assigning the correct variety and clone, and the right\nrootstock for the soil and climate \u2013 directly or indirectly addresses these two goals. For example,\nretaining leaves for a period after harvest in cold areas will contribute greatly to the cold\nhardiness of a vine.\nThe quality of Eastern wines relative to global benchmarks has been slow to improve in\nlarge part because viticultural quality has not reached a standard to produce such wines. Great\nstrides are being made in all categories of wines but the current consumer perception of Eastern\nwines reflects the challenges they face in the vineyard. All new growers are obligated to rise up\nand meet these challenges if fine wines are to be produced.\n13\nThe Importance of High Quality Viticulture in the East\nJim Law, Vigneron\nLinden Vineyards, Linden, Virginia\nPrecise, well-timed winegrowing pays the greatest dividends in Eastern North America for one\nsimple reason. It rains a lot. We have more rain during the growing season than just about any other\nviticultural region in the world. This abundance of rain makes our vines more susceptible to disease,\nexcessive vigor, and grape and wine dilution.\nThis is a painful fact that I have come to accept. Most of my management decisions are based on\nmitigating our wet climate\u201fs influence on my wines. It gives me great comfort to taste wines from two\nother wet winegrowing regions that I have learned so much from: Bordeaux and Burgundy.\nVineyard establishment decisions are critical in reducing the negative impact of a wet climate.\nMy best wines come from soils that are well drained and have a low water holding capacity. Steep\nslopes are an additional plus. Once these critical decisions are made and the vineyard is planted, the\ndifference between good wine and great wine is often the ability of a grower to execute good canopy\nmanagement. I define canopy management as the manipulation of shoots, leaves and clusters in a way\nthat enhances sunlight interception, canopy drying, and most importantly, wine quality.

I define canopy management as the manipulation of shoots, leaves and clusters in a way\nthat enhances sunlight interception, canopy drying, and most importantly, wine quality. If a vineyard\nplanting is well thought out and the vines are naturally in balance with their environment, then canopy\nmanagement work is greatly reduced. If the vines are not in balance, then the only way to produce great\nwines is by using a very heavy hand in the vineyard. This is expensive in terms of labor and is referred\nto as \u201cBand-Aid\u201d viticulture.\nThere are four basic vineyard tasks that can make or break wine quality. 1. Shoot thinning. In\nthe spring when the new shoots are young and tender, we reduce the number down to about two shoots\nper canopy foot. This opens the canopy and is our first round of yield control. 2. Shoot positioning. In\norder to have an airy open canopy, we separate and tie shoots so that they are uniformly spaced. 3. Leaf\nand lateral pulling. Just after flowering we begin to remove leaves and lateral shoots from around the\nclusters. This allows for better drying and spray coverage. 4. Cluster thinning. Most of the summer we\nare removing young clusters in an attempt to bring yields down to a level that I feel will give my wines\nconcentration and expression of terroir. For red grapes I aim for one pound of grapes per foot of canopy.\nWhites may be somewhat higher.\nThese canopy management techniques are used by the best growers world-wide. I believe that at\nthis stage in our viticultural development, precise canopy management is more important than terroir or\nwinemaking ability. This is nuts and bolts farming. It is not sexy and has limited PR value (as opposed\nto new clones, oak barrels or French consultants), but it is what works.\nAuthor\u2019s note: Jim was a contributor for many years to Wine East (now a supplement to Wines &\nVines) and Practical Winery and Vineyard. His articles are well worth seeking out and reading. He\nalso wrote Backyard Vintner, a homeowner\u2019s guide to growing and making wine. Linden Vineyards is\na premier wine estate in the Mid-Atlantic region and a visit there would be very educational.\n14\nDespite these difficulties there is no shortage of enthusiastic grape growers in the East.\nWhy? A valuable lesson I have learned since I arrived here is that people can become deeply\nattached to the place where they live for a variety of reasons. They may love and want to make\nwine, but they want to do it on the farm where their parents and grandparents lived and perhaps\nfarmed themselves. This is a deeply rooted motivation. Many of the well-endowed clients I\nwork with could own a vineyard in Napa or other areas where the wine comes easily from the\nterroir but they choose to stay close to home. From the perspective of quality and ease of\nproduction it makes little sense, but from a human standpoint is understandable. The difficulty\nfor the extension educator or consultant is to match viticulture to a lesser site instead of choosing\nan ideal site to suit the wine type and style being striven for.\nBefore continuing, therefore, I must relay a cautionary message.

The difficulty\nfor the extension educator or consultant is to match viticulture to a lesser site instead of choosing\nan ideal site to suit the wine type and style being striven for.\nBefore continuing, therefore, I must relay a cautionary message. We have many\nviticultural tools available to us, but all the knowledge, skills, tools and positive thinking in the\nworld may not be sufficient overcome the forces of nature and the hard-to-please consumer with\na globe of wines to choose from. The underlying truth is that the site features remain the key to\nhigh-quality grape production and whatever you sacrifice in terms of site quality will only\nincrease the challenges and obstacles that you will face.\n15\nChapter 3\nYou and Your Vineyard: Making the Big Decision\nThe development and management of a vineyard is not rocket science; grapevines will\ngrow just about anywhere and, once established, are actually quite difficult to kill. All the same,\nto produce a grape with the potential to make a fine wine requires a specific set of skills,\nknowledge and temperament, not to mention the financial wherewithal. In the case of fine wine,\nyou get out of it what you put in, nothing more. Qualities to be found in the great wine grower\ninclude passion, patience, persistence, flexibility, attention to detail, organizational skills,\ncreativity, curiosity, intelligence, the capacity to observe, communication skills, and above all\nthe willingness to work hard. Begin by looking in the mirror.\nThe realities of farming\nAt its core, farming is about problem solving. If you do not fancy yourself as a problem\nsolver you should avoid agriculture. Every day the vineyard will present you with a series of\nproblems that must be resolved. Can you do it? Furthermore, you will be at the mercy of\nMother Nature. Each day\u201fs effort will be guided by the weather. How flexible are you? To be\ncomfortable in this business, you need to have a high threshold for such stresses.\nAt present most of the people entering the wine industry come from other careers and\noften begin as serious hobbyists. Unlike in Europe, it is unusual for a person in the States to\ngrow up in the wine business, although we are witnessing a second generation of wine growers\nin the East. And despite our agrarian heritage, most Americans are woefully lacking in any\nknowledge or appreciation of agriculture, and just assume that farming cannot be all that difficult\nor complicated. If this is your conviction, then you need a reality check. In fact, there are few\nmore multi-faceted, financially risky, and intellectually and physically challenging jobs than\nrunning a farm. You may have been captivated by the beauty of a wine road in France or\nCalifornia, but the romance will be hard to recapture during a soggy harvest, or on a blazing hot\nday in August, or when pruning in a bitterly cold wind in winter. Unless you can afford to\ndelegate all the work, you will be dirty, sweaty, wet, hot or cold, and tired most of the time.\nWhile there is profound satisfaction to in working the land and making wine, but most of\nthe romance associated with wine is found in the retail and consumer experience. If you\ngenuinely yearn to own a vineyard, you will have to accept the fact that your daily routine will\nbe one of hard work with delayed or limited financial rewards. Oh, and just to add insult to\ninjury, if you manage your own vineyard you can forget about those leisurely summer vacations\nwith your family \u2013 miss one spray application and the entire crop could be lost to disease. Be\naware of the demands of the vineyard before you commit yourself to it.\nAll of this is being explained not to scare you off (well, it", "doc_id": "606ccc3f-b31d-419c-8f75-18c91f25d50b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0f2890dfd0623e10c16aab1969aa8b1d418244fdf739f0803c1e8a1c93f82610", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 39521, "end": 43546}, "relationships": {"1": "acd3b8f9-6274-4b01-8706-eb3b89775b72", "2": "ddca81ad-a3c6-4acd-9925-4b75a0ad1187", "3": "57890c21-0454-4968-808e-b6e4351021e7"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "57890c21-0454-4968-808e-b6e4351021e7": {"__data__": {"text": "you will be dirty, sweaty, wet, hot or cold, and tired most of the time.\nWhile there is profound satisfaction to in working the land and making wine, but most of\nthe romance associated with wine is found in the retail and consumer experience.

Be\naware of the demands of the vineyard before you commit yourself to it.\nAll of this is being explained not to scare you off (well, it is meant to scare you), but to\nput you in the picture and help you realize the responsibilities you will be taking on. I, and every\nperson in the wine industry in the East, have a stake in your success. We need you to make good\nwine, because as the industry strives to improve its products and establish its reputation, every\nsubstandard bottle has a disproportionately negative effect. If a consumer is served a bad wine in\nNapa Valley, he will just drive over to the next winery and try another. If he tastes a poor wine\nfrom Pennsylvania, he is likely never to try another and will tell all his friends to avoid local\nwines. It is therefore in every wine grower\u201fs interest to help his neighbor succeed.\n16\nThe unique challenges of growing wine in the East\nAs we have already noted, the region poses many problems in terms of wine growing and\nan important preparatory exercise for you will be to study these challenges and determine how\nyou might overcome them.\nThe central question is how to grow grapes in a warm, humid, rainy climate that\npromotes disease and insect pests beyond the worst nightmares of wine growers elsewhere, with\nthe threat of winter injury on top of that. Rain at harvest is probably the greatest test of all.\nUnder these conditions, you will have to work harder than your competitors in the drier western\nstates to attain the same quality, and even harder to excel. Consumers and critics may be aware\nof vintage variations, but in the end what they are concerned about is the price and quality of\nwhat is in the bottle, not the work that went into it. Do you have the dogged determination that it\nwill take to satisfy them?\nThe bottom line is: Can you be a\nfarmer? Or even a gentleman farmer? Be\nhonest. Can you put up with humid\nsummers and being perennially hot, sweaty\nand dirty? What about being cold, wet and\ndirty in the winter? Will gnats and flies\nbuzzing around your head for endless hours\nwhile you pull leaves drive you crazy? Are\nyou able to spend eight hours on a noisy\ntractor driving at 3 mph and cover just 24\nmiles? A lot of the work will be repetitious\nand menial, and includes simple cleaning\nand maintenance work. On a farm, things\nare always breaking and your success\ndepends to a surprising degree on your\nability to fix implements and machinery quickly. You are likely to develop a bad back, tennis\nelbow and carpal tunnel syndrome, and will find yourself visiting your doctor or hospital after\nthe occasional accident like when you hit your thumb with a hammer. Do you manage people\nwell? Do you speak Spanish? Consider these factors seriously before you cast your lot as a\nfarmer.\nInspect thy wallet\nAs with any new business, to be successful you must work out the economics of your\nproject. Do you have the financial resources to build this business and not compromise either the\nvineyard or the quality of life you are accustomed to? Read Chapter 8 carefully. You want your\nproject to be viable and this means staying within a budget and not going broke trying to make\nwine.

If you want to make a really good wine, you must accept that there is a strong correlation\nbetween what you invest and the quality of the wine that comes off the bottling line. What are\nyour goals and how much are you willing to spend to get there?\nTime\nThis is a long-term project, so ask yourself, \u201cWhy am I doing this and where do I want to\nbe in ten years?\u201d We live in a culture of instant gratification, but the vines cannot be hurried.\nVineyard Family at Pinnacle Ridge and Round Ridge\n17\nDo you have the resources, stamina and attention span to go the distance and is there a plan for\nwho will tend the vineyard after you are gone? Do you have the flexibility at work to take time\noff during the busy harvest season to bring the grapes in?\nAnother aspect of time \u2013 a precious commodity these days \u2013 is the problem of who is\nactually going to do all the work. If the answer is yourself, then you should immediately begin a\nsurvey of vineyard owners to get a realistic notion of the workload involved, and then measure it\nagainst the time that you will have at your disposal for the project. Vineyards involve a great\ndeal of hard labor. Be prepared to toil after your day job, on weekends and intensively during\nthe summer. Vines have their own schedule and you will be obliged to adjust to it.\nA corollary question is: Will the vineyard require professional intervention and seasonal\nlabor and if so, are you a good manager and \u201cpeople person\u201d? Can you deal with field workers\non a daily basis? Would you consider learning another language in order to be able to\ncommunicate better? Human resources is one of the thorniest issues in agriculture, beginning\nwith the problem of the general scarcity of agricultural workers on the East Coast, from\nmanagers down to skilled field labor and finding legal seasonal workers.\nIt is crucial that the family be on board with this idea. You will probably be working in\nthe vineyard on evenings and weekends and not everyone approves of a vineyard mistress. It\ntakes time and money to develop and maintain a vineyard \u2013 both of which are probably already\nin high demand in your family. You will be absent for long stretches during the summer, when\nyour presence will be required to hedge and spray, and at harvest when you will need days or\nsometimes weeks to get the fruit from the vines to the winery.\nRisk\nFinally, what is your risk threshold? Your investment portfolio will probably give you an\nidea of just how much risk you are willing to take on, and if you don\u201ft have an investment\nportfolio you probably don\u201ft want a vineyard. In fact, a good analogy to this business is the\nstock market; both are extraordinarily sensitive to the vagaries of nature and the consumer.\nAgriculture is by its very nature unpredictable and an upper-end commercial vineyard is\nnot for the faint of heart. According to Jim Law at Linden Vineyards, fortitude is the hallmark of\nthe successful wine grower. A lot can go wrong during the course of a year.

The pursuit of fine wine is a life-long\nendeavor in which one is always learning and adapting. If the prospect does not fill you with\nenthusiasm, then you should probably let others grow the grapes and simply enjoy the fruits of\ntheir labor. There is no shame in that and you will be one of their most knowledgeable\ncustomers.\n18\nChapter 4\nGrape and Wine Quality Defined\nQuality is a term that we use incessantly in our consumer culture, and yet it is highly\nsubjective. We may think of the Mercedes as a high-quality automobile, but mechanically it\nprobably does not have any more quality built into it than a Toyota. Each of us has a personal\nsense of what constitutes a poor, good or even great wine. In this manual, quality refers to the\nproduction of wine grapes and wines that meet international standards for the class or style of\nwine in question. Quality can exist in every category of wine, from box and jug wines and socalled \u201efighting varietals\u201f to the very expensive cult wines. However, each of these wines\nrequires quality grapes to make a sound product. And quality grapes means establishing a welldesigned and well-managed vineyard that is capable of producing uniform, fully mature grapes\nthat are free of disease and defects and (where necessary) a cold hardy vine that can survive the\nwinter.\nIn setting your goals, it is important to apply generally accepted standards \u2013 local,\ndomestic and international \u2013 within each wine category to define the quality of your product.\nWines exist along a continuum and there are quality wines, based on clearly defined criteria, at\nevery point. However, if you toss in individual preference, stylistic differences, vintage variation\nand a host of other factors, you will understand why quality is such a subjective measure.\nThe viticultural approach will vary with the type of wine, and quality must be built into\nevery phase of the vineyard operation. Developing a vineyard is something like building a\nhouse. How many of us could construct one from scratch with no prior experience? Some\npeople will act as their own general contractors and acquire enough knowledge as they go along\nto successfully complete the process. Others will hire someone to do all the work and then step\ninto an operating-management role. It\u201fs also possible to purchase a turnkey operation with\nmanagement, labor, market and reputation already in place. Electing to start with a bare piece of\nland means a complex endeavor with a great many decisions that have to be right if the whole\nstructure is not to collapse. There will be a correct way and a wrong way to do things, and in\nmany cases a short cut as well, but most of the time the long road will be the best choice. It may\nbe more expensive and time-consuming, but it will pay dividends in the wine.\nVineyard development involves hundreds of questions and the success of your vineyard\nwill depend on your ability to respond with at least an educated guess in each case. Because\nvineyards are a perennial crop, downstream adjustments can be expensive, and often impossible\nshort of tearing out the vines, so it\u201fs better to get it right at the start.

Because\nvineyards are a perennial crop, downstream adjustments can be expensive, and often impossible\nshort of tearing out the vines, so it\u201fs better to get it right at the start. The process begins by\nasking the right questions and gathering relevant, high-quality data; don\u201ft hesitate to consult as\nmany growers, winemakers and consultants as you need to. Then you can create options and\nchoose what appears to be the best solution. Finding the answers will be time-consuming, but\nlook on it as an adventure.\nEvery wine region comes with its own traditions. In the East the post-Prohibition wine\nindustry began to expand in the 1960s based native and hybrid varieties developed over previous\ndecades. The practices applied to the cultivation of these varieties do not always meet the needs\nof European varieties. A vineyard in the Medoc, for example, represents the product of centuries\nof observation and study of what, where, how, and why specific viticulture phenomena occur and\nhow they impact wine quality. In trying to grow the best grapes possible, your goal must be to\nanswer as many of these questions as you can, drawing on the experience of others and on the\n19\nlatest developments in materials, viticulture practices and so on, in order to create a vineyard on\na site that lacks such a historical record.\nTo attain your quality goals you should learn both traditional and modern practices.\nRegions such as Australia and California used technology in the vineyard and cellar to close the\nquality gap with their Old World rivals, but then circled back to integrate traditional methods,\nespecially cellar practices, to give their wines a more artistic imprint. Technology and tradition\nshould not be considered antagonistic; in fact, Old World regions have adopted practices from\nthe New World to help them make better and more consistent wines (using the rolled steel pencil\nstake rather than the more traditional string to train new vines, for example). We are not dealing\nwith either-or situations and often a carefully chosen combination of old and new practices may\nbe ideal.\nVineyard size is an important decision that has quality implications, because it will\ndirectly impact the amount of time, effort and money you will be called upon to invest. A\ncommercial wine vineyard can exist in any size from a few vines to thousands of acres (most in\nthe East are small by comparison to those in Western states) but it is always important to\nremember that the goal is quality, not quantity. The advice offered by experts to new growers is\nto start small and expand gradually with the experience that you have gained from farming\nwithin the limits of your means and ability. Too much vineyard will end up sacrificing quality,\nwith possible long-term vine health and productivity consequences. It is more rewarding to grow\nfewer high quality grapes than a lot of mediocre grapes. Smaller vineyards have higher unit\ncosts, but are more manageable. Keep in mind that vineyards are very sensitive to neglect; if at\nany point you lose interest, your lack of enthusiasm will almost immediately show up in the\nquality of grapes and the wine. Before making any grandiose plans, keep in mind that a raggedlooking vineyard may not compromise quality, but the perception of winemakers and the public\ncould be adversely affected.

The best growers\nwill say anywhere from 6 to 18 months, not including the property search, but it is actually\nimpossible to predict because it depends on so many variables: how much time you have to\nresearch the project, the land evaluation and preparation process, the availability of vine\nmaterials, and so on and on. The planning and development phase must be flexible and should\nnever be hurried.\nA vineyard has a different pace from most things that we are accustomed to in our hurryup, get-it-done-yesterday culture. After a vine is planted, it typically takes three years to reach\nthe first harvest, and another ten before the true nature and potential of the vineyard is revealed.\nIf red wine is being made, it will probably not be in the stores for another year or two, and\nsometimes more, after the grapes are harvested. But if the vine stays healthy it can produce fruit\nfor twenty or thirty years or more. Clearly, this is not a business for those who are in a hurry to\nclear a profit or drink their own wine. In Europe vineyard time is marked in centuries, with\ngenerations of owners lovingly cultivating the same small plot of vines. The vigneron makes\ndecisions that will have consequences for his children, and quite possibly his children\u201fs children.\nThis is the cycle and pace of the vine. If you are entering the business to escape the rat race, then\nyou must be prepared to put on the brakes and live according to vine time. Hasty decisions will\ncompromise the quality of the grapes and, ultimately, the wine.\nEverything begins with the site, and finding one should not take more than a year of\nfocused property hunting, assuming that the general area you are looking at lies within the\nbounds of viticultural reason. The key to success here is to know beforehand exactly what you\nare looking for, and to find the right people to help you. Your viticulture education should be\ntaking place simultaneously with this search.\nOnce you have a vineyard site, your time line will depend on the process of evaluation,\nplanning, acquiring plant materials, and site preparation. If a field is being replanted from vines\nor fruit trees or is being cleared of forest, it should be left fallow for at least one year and up to\ntwo to three years if nematodes and soil-borne pathogens are present.\nVariety and rootstock selection will be influenced by the site\u201fs characteristics, so at least\nthis part of the evaluation process must be finished before you place an order. If grafted vinifera\nvines are a part of your plan, these should be ordered 15-18 months prior to April of the year that\nyou will be planting. During the period that the young vines are being grown by the nursery,\nmuch of the site preparation work can be done. If you have chosen own-rooted or readily\navailable grafted vines, the gap between ordering the vines and planting them can be narrowed\nconsiderably, but not to much less than the summer prior to the spring planting date if you are to\nget all the preparatory work done properly. The worst thing that a grower can do is to become\nimpatient and rush the process.

The best vineyards are carefully planned and\nnever hurried, from the first crop to the last.\nThe following is a sample timeline for developing a vineyard:\n1. The ah-ha moment\n2. Find a vineyard site (0-2 years). Organize financing and create a business plan. Start\ncollecting local climate data. Make contacts with winery customers. Begin your\n21\nviticulture education process. Attend workshops for new growers. Consider hiring\nconsultants. Find a high-quality vineyard where you can do intensive internship work\nduring the crucial summer, harvest, and pruning seasons.\n3. Year 0 / Summer: Conduct soil evaluations when the soil is dry. Do GIS and GPS\nmapping of the soils, slope, aspect, hazards, and other topographic features that may\ninfluence development decisions. Create maps and an operational plan based on this data\nin which decisions regarding row direction, row length, vine spacing, trellis design, soil\namendments, water development, cultivars, clones and rootstocks are made.\n4. Year 0 / Fall: Order plant materials from reliable nurseries for planting in Year 2 /\nSpring. Clear the land and plant a winter cover crop.\n5.

The\nfirst question then becomes: How can one close the knowledge gap and turn an appreciation of\nwine into a skill for cultivating vines? This can be done, but how?\nIt is difficult because it involves effort, and time that busy people simply do not have.\nBut it can also be interesting and fun as an understanding of the story behind a wine develops\nand new people and places are encountered. Developing a high-quality vineyard requires finding\nand utilizing knowledge properly and, like any other discipline, there is much you need to know\nto do it well. Knowledge will lead to experience, and eventually you will become a wine grower.\nThere is a lot of homework involved in establishing a vineyard and the learning never ends, even\nafter you are successfully growing grapes. Most growers say that it takes at least ten years to get\nto know and understand a new vineyard so, even after the vineyard is planted, it is constantly\nproviding feedback to you about the site and vines. Whether in a structured learning setting or\non your own, there is a strong correlation between the amount of effort you put in before and\nduring the vineyard development process and the quality of the grapes the vines will produce.\nYou may be tempted to give short shrift to this part of the project because of other commitments\nbut the results will show in poor early fruit and wine quality.\nAcquire the necessary know-how for the style and type of wine you want to grow,\nbeginning with the basics of viticulture, which then can be tailored to your goals. There are\nvarious options available ranging from formal study to self-learning and the school of hard\nknocks. There are outstanding two- and four-year curriculums in viticulture and enology at\nschools across North America. These range from practical, hands-on vocational training\nprograms at community colleges such as Chemeketa Community College in Salem, Oregon, and\nSurry Community College in Dobson, North Carolina to full-scale undergraduate and graduate\nstudies at Cornell University and the University of California at Davis, to name just a few.\nFormal schooling with a solid grounding in biology, chemistry, and the plant and food sciences\nmay seem daunting, but will certainly help to make you a better wine grower and winemaker.\nYou will emerge prepared to make critical decisions, but what will still be missing are the\npractical skills needed to master the daily tasks in a vineyard or winery. Many programs have\npracticum components that involve internships or other types of training in the wine industry.\nHands-on experience can be the most valuable form of education of all, so find a good vineyard\nor winery that will let you help prune, drag hoses, and work on weekends in the summer, during\nharvest and in the winter. The most motivated learner will target a region and producer whose\nwines are similar to those that he wishes to make, and will work for a significant period in that\nproducer\u201fs vineyard and cellar.

The best time is just before veraison and through the harvest\nseason, when the vines are in full flourish and you can study at first hand all the principles and\npractices that bring the vine and fruit to the point of making wine. Even if you believe that you\nare prepared, you will manage your vineyard better if you get some real experience in a winery,\nand the same applies to the wine maker.\nIt is helpful to know conversational Spanish if you plan to have employees. Depending\non how deeply you want to delve into other traditions and the type of wine you are aiming to\nmake, learning French, German and/or Italian could also be useful.\n23\nFew Americans start out wanting to be grape growers or wine makers and even fewer\nwill have the opportunity to learn this profession working in the family business. In fact, the\npeople running vineyards and wineries in the East are generally self-taught and the majority are\ncompetent, a handful are outstanding, and some never quite figure out what is going on. If you\nwant to excel, your chances will be better with some formal training. However, few newcomers\nto this industry can afford to spend long periods of time away from their family and regular job\nstudying in a formal educational program. This means committing yourself to self-learning,\nwhich will require discipline, perseverance, and finding the right resources to help you reach\nyour goal. Fortunately for the self-learner, there is a wealth of outstanding published and webbased teaching materials available. The new grower materials highlighted in the information\nresources list may eclipse the knowledge contained in a formal educational program.\nWhatever approach you choose, be aware that there are programs and instructional\nmaterials of dubious quality from which you may learn incorrect concepts and questionable\npractices without realizing it. You should always check on the reliability of the resources you\nhave decided to use. Verify the source! This is the only way to ensure the quality of your\neducation. If you are going to enroll in a school, compare programs and pick the one that has a\ngood reputation and will meet your needs. If you want to work at a vineyard as an intern or a\nvolunteer, make sure it is a high quality operation with competent staff who can train you\nproperly. If you are reading books, choose the highest quality texts that will fill your specific\nknowledge needs. Learning the wrong lessons or picking up bad habits that will hamper you and\nyour vines until they can be corrected. It pays to take the time to find and learn from the best\navailable teachers, books, vineyards, etc.\nExperienced members of the wine industry will be one of your most valuable resources,\nbut study as much as you can about viticulture and enology before you start talking to them.\nBusy owners and managers don\u201ft have time to waste on every person who strolls into the tasting\nroom and says, \u201cSo, how do I start a vineyard (or winery)?\u201d They have ways of detecting who is\nserious and who is not, for example, by introducing technical terms into the conversation in order\nto gauge a visitor\u201fs level of knowledge.

Wineries and vineyards\nalways need help. Having a passion for the work will offset your lack of experience. Valuable\ntraining can be gained by providing your services for free over a weekend or even an entire year\nif you can afford it. The secret is to find the right mentor, with a business that matches your\ngoals and will provide you with the most relevant information and experience. To ensure a\nproper match, some preliminary scouting will be necessary. While they may be interviewing you\nfor a position, you should be doing the same right back at them to make sure they can service\nyour needs.\nVisiting vineyards and wineries will form an essential part of your education, and you\nshould be observant and analytical. These will no longer be casual visits for fun and mere wine\ntasting. Try to see what is being done and understand why. Ask intelligent questions, and\ndetermine how you can translate this information to your own vineyard. If it looks like the\ngrower knows what he is doing, probe deeper and ask if you can take photos of the vineyard.\nTaste wines critically and purposefully. It is important to form impressions of what varieties will\nperform best in a given area. Eventually you will be making enduring choices regarding\n24\nvarieties, clones and rootstocks, and what you learn at these wineries will provide helpful\nindicators of what may be successful on your site. Study how a vineyard or winery balances the\nmarketability of a variety with its suitability to a particular area and vineyard site. Be sensible\nand courteous in the pursuit of information. Do not overstay your welcome. Bring the same list\nof questions along on each visit so you can cross-reference the answers from different sources.\nLocal information, especially if it comes from extension educators or farmers in the area\nwith orchards or vineyards, trumps just about everything else. They have valuable experience,\nespecially with regard to questions of climate and soils. They may even be able to help you with\nmarketing questions.\nThe value of networking cannot be overstated, and now would be a good time to join\nyour regional or state wine or growers association. Their members and programs can be\nenormously helpful in providing information and data about such things as varietal selection,\nclimate, soils, etc. Do not be shy as a prospective wine grower to attend viticulture seminars,\nworkshops, field days, etc. While not all of the information will immediately accessible to you,\nit is still worthwhile to see different vineyards and hear the language of viticulture spoken.\nGradually everything will become clearer. This is the best way to learn about the latest\ndevelopments in research and practice and also provides a good opportunity to meet fellow\ngrowers and to start building a viticulture network. Don\u201ft forget that you can also learn a lot in\ncasual conversation.\nLarger meetings and conventions will have trade shows that are packed with the latest\ngadgets for the vineyard and cellar. You can benefit greatly from attending the Unified\nSymposium held every January in Sacramento, CA and the annual conference of the American\nSociety for Enology and Viticulture (ASEV).

Ask around or take the time to figure out who among them really understands\nvineyards and their products. Although you should not forget that their ultimate goal is to sell\nyou something (beware of overly aggressive sales pitches), vendors can give you sound advice in\ntheir areas of expertise.\nGet to know your local extension\nservice, an invaluable source of information\nand expertise. Just remember that extension\neducators are there to serve the regional or\nstate wine industry as a whole and should not\nbe viewed as free consultants. Extension\neducators tend to know the big picture of the\nwine industry better than the fine detail of\nvineyard development. But they are experts\nat directing you to helpful resources. They\nmay make one or two visits to your vineyard\ndepending on the nature of their program.\nTry to sense how much time they can spend\nhelping you. Some extension programs offer\nspecific workshops for people who are\nDr. Richard Smart, the Flying Vine Doctor at extension field\nmeeting, Waltz Vineyards, Manheim, PA.\n25\nconsidering planting a vineyard. This would be a good time to sign up for newsletters and get\nonto e-mail lists to receive practical information and announcements of upcoming viticulture and\nenology events (see information resources section).\nThere is more than enough published material to keep you busy and much of it is of\nexcellent quality. If you are going the self-taught route, you will find books, trade magazines,\nand academic journals galore. Rely on trusted sources whether it\u201fs a wine maker, trade\nmagazine but especially when using the Internet; Google \u201cviticulture\u201d and see what happens!\nRead as much as you can in all categories and disciplines. Viticulture texts are often broad in\nscope, so you should supplement them with the best regional information available. Integrate the\npractical with the technical, the theoretical and with basic science. Practical guides teach \u201chow\nto\u201d. Basic science teaches \u201cwhy\u201d. Do you really need to know the difference between the xylem\nand phloem of the vine\u201fs vascular system? Perhaps not, but it will help you to appreciate the\ncomplexity of vine anatomy and physiology and understand the why of certain practices. And, it\nis worth reiterating \u2013 always check on the reliability of the materials you will be using.\n26\nAppendix B\nFive Philosophies to Ponder\nGalen Troxell, Wine Grower\nGalen Glen Vineyard, Andreas, Pennsylvania\n1.

Things that growers in\nestablished regions think are trivial or common knowledge are often the missing details for\ngreatness at your location.\n4. Always have a goal and vision in mind. Remember that growing grapes is both a challenging\njourney and an agricultural process, not something that just happens. Think of the grape and\nwine industry like a life-long chess match that requires you to evaluate and calculate your next\nmoves. Most of us get about thirty growing seasons to create something very special. Vineyards\nrequire many hours on a tractor and this is a great time to evaluate where you are with respect to\nyour goals. Perseverant individuals as a rule win in the end. Each year is a new one that should\nbuild on the previous year. Evaluate what is working and what is not. Develop plans to address\nthe shortcomings. Always invest in getting better. This is a global business with some of the\nmost intelligent and driven individuals in the world working in it, so the competition is fierce.\n5. What is the definition of productivity in a vineyard? One of the best answers I heard to this\nquestion was: 1.5 lbs per linear foot of trellis for reds and 2.0 lbs per linear foot of trellis for\nwhites. Per vine or per acre is often used, but does not seem to do justice to the subject.\nFor example, the difference between 7-foot row spacing and 10-foot row spacing with\nrespect to the above definition is a 30% differential. Your location, site, variety and\ngoals will impact the absolute numbers that will work for your situation. The \u201erow to\nrow\u201f spacing is the volume knob, and the \u201ein the row\u201f spacing needs to provide a\nbalanced vine that requires a minimal amount of inputs with respect to tools such as\nfertilizer or canopy management.\n27\nIt would be well worth your time to visit vineyards in your area, in your region, around\nthe United States, and abroad, as this will only help to make you a better grower. I call this\nintentional viticultural travel. At the advanced level, it may be the most effective way to learn\nabout new and innovative ideas and practices. At the novice level it is less effective but still\nworthwhile. Look for the best examples of vineyard development and maintenance and try to\nunderstand why a particular vineyard may be special. Ask the growers intelligent questions\nprepared in advance, because the best ones do not simply \u201esee\u201f, they also observe, learn from\nothers and put this knowledge into practice. Good growers connect the dots between cause and\neffect and often between multiple variables. If you want to grow great Merlot, visit vineyards on\nLong Island, in California, and on the right bank of Bordeaux. If you want to grow fine Riesling,\nthere are lessons to be learned in the Finger Lakes area, Ontario, Germany, Austria and Alsace.\nAt the time of this writing, Long Island and the Niagara Peninsula offer the best and most\nconsistent examples of high-quality wine growing in the non-Western states and provinces. A\ntour of both these regions would be extremely instructive. You could even consider hiring a\nconsultant to spend the day with you, visiting vineyards and explaining their practices.\nThe growing conditions in arid regions such as California, Chile and Australia are very\ndifferent from those in the Eastern U.S., so their knowledge and experiences will need to be\nsifted and translated before they can be applied. However, California remains the source of most\nnew technology and knowledge in viticulture, so close attention should be paid to anything\ncoming out of that state.\nThe best wine growers travel extensively to learn what others do, but it is important to\nuse common sense and apply what will work in your vineyard.

Just consider the astounding sight of bud break each spring. There are\nbiological reasons for this natural phenomenon, but it is no less miraculous to witness and we go\nthrough each winter keeping faith that shoots will appear every spring. It is important to accept\nthe fact that not everything we see in the vineyard can be explained.\nExperience will come gradually, as you get to know your vines and how to best tend\nthem, what works and what doesn\u201ft. This will depend on your ability to observe and understand\nthe complex relationships that make up the vineyard\u201fs different parts \u2013 biological (Mother\nNature), mechanical (man and his machines), and practical (the technical know-how of\nviticulture). Understanding cause and effect will make you a better grower: \u201cI see such-and-such\nand afterwards so-and-so happens\u201d or \u201cI do this, and as a result that happens.\u201d In the U.S.\ngrowers learn to scout their vineyards for signs of problems but our training is not a rigorous and\ndoes not have the weight of history to help explain things.\nIntuition is a sixth sense that develops out of experience, a seemingly mysterious\nknowledge that is actually empirical in origin. Intuition is the ability to predict an event based on\npresent conditions and data inputs, the weather being a prime example since it plays such an\nimportant role in every vineyard decision during the growing season. It takes at least ten years to\ndevelop a modicum of intuition in this business and not everyone succeeds. The Europeans seem\nto be the masters of empirical wine growing based on observation and reasoning; in historic\n28\nregions they use information and intuition gained over the course of centuries to produce their\nwines.\nAs a new grower, while you are learning and honing your skills you will probably need\nsome guidance. The wine industry is well known for the generosity of its members in sharing\ninformation, because they realize that helping others will in the long run benefit their business\nand the industry at large, and chances are that someone helped them when they got started.\nNewcomers will often find fellow growers, producers and extension educators who are happy to\nshare their knowledge, but you can only take so much advantage of their good will and you may\neventually wish to enter into a more formal arrangement with a vineyard consultant.\nIs a consultant really necessary?

Through your neighbors, you can find out who the consultants are and\nwhat the community thinks of them.\nSome consultants have websites that can be found through state grape grower associations.\nIn Virginia, you would Google the Virginia Vineyards Association. The bottom line is, if you ask\naround you can find help. If you are not inclined to ask around and get to know fellow grape\ngrowers, perhaps you should rethink your reasons for wanting a vineyard.\nAre you the kind of person who utilizes and can seriously evaluate advice from someone\nelse? It\u201fs okay at all times to reject a consultant's advice. The important thing is to understand why\nhe or she gave you that advice. Your consultant can be your most important teacher, but it is also\nimportant to seek out all educational opportunities, through such entities as your state agricultural\nextension or, once again, your state growers\u201f association.

If you are looking for land to buy, let a\nconsultant help evaluate the proposed purchase.

If you already own the land,\nyour consultant can give you the positive and negative vineyard attributes of your property; for\nexample, which parts of your property will grow which varieties best.\nNearly everyone who plants a vineyard in Virginia has never grown a grapevine before in\ntheir life. Some have never grown a plant of any kind and now they want to plant and tend\nthousands. Don't be overconfident in your skills. Listen to your peers. They have been there, done\nthat. DO NOT RE-INVENT THE WHEEL. Learn from everyone else's mistakes, and we have\nmade a plenty of them.\nAnother important question is, how do you pay your consultant - by the hour, day, month,\nyear, or job? If you pay by the hour, how do you know when to call your consultant? Remember,\nyou have never grown grapevines before. If you think you are having a problem, well, just how big\nan old problem is it? Should you call in your consultant now and spend all that money? Or, should\nyou wait and see how things go? If you are just starting out, pay your consultant so that you feel\nfree to contact her or her anytime you want. This probably means paying a monthly or yearly fee.\nConsultants like clients who ask questions and are a little paranoid. We like people who are\nREALLY interested in what they are doing. Remember this: if you are my client and do a poor job,\nit makes me look bad, no matter that it may not be my fault. If you do a great job and have a very\nsuccessful vineyard, it makes me look good regardless of my role. It is extremely important to my\nbusiness that you succeed.\n30\nSite evaluation is one of the most critical steps in vineyard development. Here is where a\nsoil consultant would be of immense value in determining the physical, chemical and biological\nnature of your soil so that proper amendments, improvements and rootstock assignments can be\nmade. You only have one chance to do this correctly and in your eagerness to get started you\nmay be tempted to rush through the process. But now is the time to be logical and methodical.\nAll of us tend to make the same predictable vineyard mistakes when we don't benefit from other\npeople's experience. These mistakes can be costly and enduring. A good consultant's advice will save you\nthe consulting fees for mistakes and much more every year if you develop a strong partnership.\nAnother option that would greatly ease your way is to hire a vineyard development\nservice. Unfortunately, there are few such services available at the present time in the East. The\nsituation should improve as the regional wine industry expands and offers more opportunities. If\nyou decide to hire out the development work rather than do it yourself with a consultant, take the\ntime to check their references thoroughly.

The moment you do, you will be going backwards in your pursuit of quality.\nA Footnote: Wines and Vines\nIs it necessary to drink wine to be a good wine grower? If your aim is to achieve the\nhighest quality, the answer is an emphatic \u201eyes\u201f. In much of the Old World the grape grower and\nthe winemaker are the same person. Information need only cross from one side of the brain to\nthe other. In France there are no separate terms to distinguish the winemaker from the grape\ngrower: a vigneron grows the wine from vine to bottle. In the New World, independent\nvineyards often operate separately from the winery. In this scenario, there is some distance\nbetween the grower and the wine. The shrewd grower understands the symbiotic relationship\nbetween vine and wine and seeks knowledge in both viticulture and enology that will enhance\ncommunication with the winemaker. After all, your objective is to grow the high-quality grapes\nneeded to make specific wines.\nUnderstanding what constitutes a\ngood wine will help you to define and\nachieve this goal. If you identify a\nbenchmark \u2013 for example, a Burgundy Pinot\nNoir or a red Bordeaux blend \u2013 as the\nobjective for your vineyard, then you can\nstudy the details of how it is made, which\ninvolves working backward from the wine\nthrough the winery to the vineyard. You can\nthen use this knowledge in your vineyard\nevaluation and development process.\nOnce wines are made from your\ngrapes, tasting them will provide clues as to\nwhat has or has not happened in the vineyard,\nand valuable lessons can be learned. For\nexample, if a red wine is herbaceous and tart, perhaps the fruit was not fully mature when\nharvested and leaf removal was not carried out properly. Why did this happen, and how can it be\nWine making technical workshop with Brian Wilson from\nKeystone Cooperage\n31\navoided next year? Analyzing backwards from the finished wine to viticulture in the field is an\nimportant exercise and helps to push quality forward.\nThe vineyard and the grapes it produces should have a goal in wine. Benchmark wines\nare also important because of the subjective nature of wine appreciation. Pinot Noir presents a\nclassic example; some prefer the more delicate and elegant style of a Burgundy, while others\ninsist on the superiority of big, fruit-bomb wines from sun-drenched California. These are two\ngreat, but very different styles of Pinot Noir and one could argue forever about their relative\nmerits. However, there is general agreement that a wine with very light, cherry fruit, no midpalate and a tart finish may be technically correct but cannot be considered a benchmark wine. It\nconstitutes a midpoint along the continuum leading to the great wines. \u201eTechnically correct\u201f\nshould be your starting point, the absolute minimum that you are willing to accept for your\ngrapes. A better site, more resources and better viticulture will possibly allow you to achieve a\nsuperior wine.\nIn order to calibrate your palate, you need to taste wines analytically in the company of\nknowledgeable professionals.

This exercise is\nessential if you want to learn how to connect wines to the vineyard.\nTaste wines both with and without food. It is a revelation to drink Eastern wines with\nfood because they, like their European cousins, tend towards more food-friendly acidity and\nconcentration than arid region wines. Understanding the relationship between food and wine on\nall levels \u2013 the sensory, the social and the emotional \u2013 will help you to become a better wine\ngrower. Use proper tasting procedures and tools such as the right serving temperature, decanting\nfor red wines, good stemware, and a proper setting.\nWine and viticulture education can be taken a step further into the world of food, dining,\nservice, and sales \u2013 what tends to draw people to the vineyard in the first place. While selling a\nbottle may seem far removed from the activities in the vineyard, they are in fact intimately\nconnected. Growers who can line up their goals with the needs of producers and the preferences\nof consumers will be better prepared to negotiate the tortuous path from vine to table. This is\nessential because the economics of growing wine works in reverse \u2013 from the consumer opening\nthe bottle with your grapes in it, back through to the winery and what it is willing to pay for your\ngrapes based on the retail price.\nIn addition to understanding wine and food, you should learn something about the\nwinemaking process. You do not need an enology degree, but understanding the fundamentals\nwill allow you to communicate with winemakers and integrate your practices with their goals.\nThe successful grape grower makes the wine maker\u201fs job easy. A winemaker will be striving to\nachieve a certain style and his intentions must be translated into actions in the vineyard. You\nshould also be sensitive to each winemaker\u201fs personality. As in every sphere, there are people\nwho will be easy to work with and those who demand a little more effort. You need to figure out\nhow to work together effectively to your mutual benefit and that of the wine.\n32\nChapter 7\nFarm Safety\nSafety is a subject that is often buried or not even mentioned in agricultural guides, but it\nmay be the most important chapter in this manual to you and your family.

You and others will be working with and around large equipment, power tools, heavy\nitems, electricity, sharp objects, pesticides, and so on, and visitors will also be exposed to these\ndangers. Tractor roll-over and power take-off accidents are common and need to be guarded\nagainst. Every single farm operation should be evaluated from a safety perspective. All safety\nrequirements, rules, regulations, and postings regarding equipment, pesticides, safe re-entry into\na field, etc. exist for a reason and should be followed to the letter. Above all, common sense,\npatience, careful observation, and sound judgment must be applied every minute of every\nworking day.\nSafety is the first thing that you should think about each morning before you start. Your\nlocal cooperative extension service probably offers workshops in farm safety. If you have kids,\nplease visit \u201cFarm Safety 4 Just Kids\u201d at http://www.fs4jk.org/. Google \u201efarm safety\u201f for further\ninformation that, while not specific to vineyards, will still provide helpful tips. It is paramount,\nespecially if you do not have a farming background, to be aware of the safety and health hazards\nto be found on a farm. Gempler\u201fs, Inc. is a company that specializes in farm safety equipment\nand clothing, so start by visiting their web site and getting a copy of their catalog. Government\nagencies such as your state\u201fs Bureau of Labor and the federal Environmental Protection Agency\ncompile and enforce safety and health regulations that apply both in and around the vineyard.\nYou should be fully apprised of these regulations. Understand the requirements for safety\ntraining if you have employees, and go through with it! These laws are enforced and fines can\nbe levied or a business suspended if non-compliance is verified.\nFortunately, grape growing does not have to rely on highly toxic pesticides, but most\nvineyards use fungicides, insecticides and herbicides. All of these can pose threats to human\nhealth and the environment if not properly used. New grape growers frequently make careless\nmistakes when handling and applying pesticides. They may select the wrong material and apply\nit at an incorrect rate or too often. Frequently the application device may not be properly\ncalibrated. Calibrating a sprayer is not something you learn in college, nor is it completely\nintuitive. Find out where you can learn to do it right. It makes no sense to apply expensive\nmaterials to your vines if it is not done correctly. Use the proper, label-required personal\nprotective equipment including clothing and other protective devices (goggles, gloves,\nrespirators) to ensure the safe handling and application of pesticides.\nAll grape growers are strongly encouraged to study for and pass their state\u201fs pesticide\napplicators examination. Most growers will be licensed as private applicators, meaning that they\ncan use approved materials, but only on their own farms. If you don\u201ft have a license, you can\nturn to commercial applicators who contract their work to farms. The safety, proper handling\nand usage training that you undergo to prepare for the applicators exam will make your farm a\n33\nsafer place, maximize the effectiveness of your products, and minimize the need for off-farm\ninputs. All growers, even those who have no hired employees, should be familiar with the EPA\nworker protection standards, which are designed to protect the health of you and your family, as\nwell as employees. The study materials and examination are prepared by the state Department of\nAgriculture and can often be obtained at your county extension office.\nThere are other organizations and agencies that can assist you with safety training and\ncompliance.

Every accident could\nhave been prevented.\n34\nChapter 8\nThe Economics and Business of Grape Growing:\nThe Hard Truth about Money and Vineyards\nNowadays most people get into the vineyard business simply because they love wine.\nMany do not stop to consider the economic side of developing and operating a vineyard. It may\nbegin as a hobby and then grow into a business. The usual scenario involves someone who\nmakes surprisingly good wines at home and is encouraged by family and friends, \u201cHey, you\ncould sell this stuff!\u201d The light bulb blinks on and the snowball starts rolling down the hill.\nBefore you start, it is important to have a clear understanding of your goals. If your\nvineyard is part of an estate winery, what style and price point of wine do you expect to produce?\nIf it\u201fs a $40 Bordeaux red blend, the dynamics will be completely different from making a $10\nConcord or Niagara wine. The $10 wine will require more productive soils to support higher\nyields and this should guide site selection, just as a high-priced red wine from a high density\nvineyard will have its own particular site and cost requirements. If yours is an independent\nvineyard that will sell grapes to local wineries, the economics are challenging and you must\noptimize yields without sacrificing quality in order to be financially sustainable. Be aware that\nthe independent vineyard as a self-sustaining business is going the way of the dinosaur. If this is\nyour ambition, you must study the spreadsheet and consult other growers to determine the\nfeasibility of your project. Having a day job that can prop up the business will tip the balance in\nyour favor, as long as that outside income continues to come in.\nThere is an expression in agriculture that describes two different approaches to farming,\nthose who \u201cfarm with money\u201d and those who \u201cfarm for money.\u201d In the capital-intensive, new\nage wine industry there are plenty of the former, but I endorse and advocate for the latter. There\nmay be tax reasons to lose money, but eventually it\u201fs about managing a business and for it to be\nsustainable it must make money. In our culture when money is at stake, everything is taken\nmuch more seriously. A vineyard can turn out to be a bottomless pit financially, and a winery\ncan be even worse. For this reason, it is essential that you do some careful research on the\npotential costs and cash flows. You can begin with information from economic workbooks and\ncalculators, but nothing can substitute common sense, business savvy, and the advice of those\nwho have already written checks for their own vineyards.\nInvestigate your vineyard\u201fs economics thoroughly and in detail. Above all, talk to\nexperienced (and preferably profitable) growers. Find a recently established vineyard that is\nsimilar in design and goals to your own and get information from the owner regarding the real\ncosts", "doc_id": "04817e37-6dcf-49e5-a864-8d6417a35234", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5c5581c96f3a5accdb7f945319f27034ea267d7b4cd911227e0a27d638d2922b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 120617, "end": 124726}, "relationships": {"1": "acd3b8f9-6274-4b01-8706-eb3b89775b72", "2": "cf3fb5a2-1e11-4968-99b3-792ec695c395", "3": "59e2d2b6-2bf0-44ab-a30d-14d7dfe083b3"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "59e2d2b6-2bf0-44ab-a30d-14d7dfe083b3": {"__data__": {"text": "for it to be\nsustainable it must make money.

Above all, talk to\nexperienced (and preferably profitable) growers. Find a recently established vineyard that is\nsimilar in design and goals to your own and get information from the owner regarding the real\ncosts of running his business. The person who writes the checks knows the real costs. Your\nlocal wine or grape growers association may be able to provide economic information and the\nnames of growers to contact. The vineyard should be fun, but if it threatens to turn into a\nfinancial disaster the joy will quickly disappear.\nIt isn\u201ft difficult to estimate the main costs of developing a vineyard, and there are\nexcellent calculating tools readily available (see Information Resources). Your development and\nbusiness plans will necessarily be dynamic documents since it is impossible to anticipate every\nvariable in such a complex process. But you need a plan to guide the way, and you can always\nmake adjustments as you go along. It would probably not be unwise to calculate a budget and\nthen double it to arrive at a fairly realistic project cost.\nWhile it is not essential to have a large amount of capital to start a commercial wine\nvineyard, the reality is that it certainly helps. No matter what region you find yourself in, there is\n35\na strong correlation between the quality of the wine and the quality of the vineyards and wineries\nthat produced it. Having ample funds available translates into more choices and the leeway to\ncorrect your errors. Great wines can spring from all kinds of beginnings in terms of people,\nplaces and resources \u2013 rich or modest, statement wineries or simple pole barns, and the whole\ngamut of vineyards from the disease-infested, semi-abandoned site to the perfectly manicured,\nEnglish-garden style vineyard \u2013 but it is easy to throw good money after bad, so pay close\nattention to the budget from the very outset. Vinifera vineyards require the greatest demands on\ncapital, while hybrid and native vineyards tend to be less expensive to develop and maintain.\nThe site: the biggest up-front expenditure\nFine wine has a better chance to emerge from the well-tended vineyard, but the strength\nof a site may drive the wines in a rustic vineyard to higher-than-expected quality. Since the most\nimportant variable by far in your project will be the vineyard site, you should start by investing\nin the best one you can find and afford. This will enhance your chances of producing a fine wine\nin the face of considerable odds, especially in difficult vintages. Vineyards can vary\nsignificantly in quality. Some sites are so poor that the vines will never be more than mediocre\nno matter how much money you throw at them. However, in most cases a vineyard\u201fs\nperformance can be improved if the quality of the viticulture applied to it is ambitious. The more\nflaws a vineyard site has, the more effort and expense will have to be invested to make it perform\nwell, from development to annual operating costs during the life of the vineyard.\nLand is almost always the greatest development expense, unless you already own a site;\nthis certainly gives you an advantage, assuming that the site is suitable and will not require\nexpensive modification or applied viticulture to make it viable as a vineyard. These days, when\na vineyard industry takes hold in an area, a \u201evineyard property\u201f is often more expensive than a\nsimilar site without this designation, because the locals think that prospective vineyard owners\nare wealthy and can pay more for land.

Be aware of this bias as you search and discuss land\nvalues.\nA recent development is the establishment of vineyards as an investment and/or as a\nhedge against urban development. Because of their relatively high return on investment,\nvineyards are one of the few agricultural undertakings that make sense in areas with high\nproperty values. If you factor in the value added by wine production, they appear to be an even\nmore attractive proposition. Hence there is a trend to sign vineyard property into local\nconservancy programs in order to preserve America\u201fs agriculture and open space heritage.\nThe scope of this manual does not include a detailed analysis of development and\noperational costs, but a number of business resources, including vineyard cost calculators, are\nlisted in the Information Resources section. These tools can help you to work out your expenses.\nRunning a few models and comparing the results will give you a good idea of your prospective\nexpenses. You should always do a reality check, however, by consulting experienced local\ngrowers.\nGrowing the most expensive grapes is not always the shortest or surest route to success or\nprofitability. A fertile, deep, flat site may be best suited for development as a \u201eproduction\u201f\nvineyard with larger yields of a high-quality hybrid such as Vidal, suitable for making a good\nfighting varietal wine with an excellent value-price ratio. In terms of potential farm-gate value,\nthis type of vineyard can be just as profitable as an ultra-premium one, or even more so.\n36\nThe rest of your budget\nOnce you know how much you will be investing in the purchase of a site, you should\nstart projecting the remainder of your budget, which will include a bewildering array of\nelements. The type of vine and the vine density will have a significant impact on development\ncosts; compare, for example, own-rooted Vidal on 10 x 6 spacing (726 vines/acre @ $2/vine)\nwith Cabernet Sauvignon 337 grafted on Riparia Gloire rootstock on 7 x 3 spacing (2075\nvines/acre @ $3.50/vine). Other development expenses include trellis materials, consulting and\nprofessional support, labor for installation and operations, infrastructure (buildings, water,\nelectricity, etc.), equipment (tractor, sprayer, etc.), and apparently optional items (irrigation,\ndrain tiles, deer fence, etc.) that could make the difference between a good wine and great wine\nin any given vintage. There are absolute essentials, essentials, and elements that are nonessential but desirable in vineyard development, and it will be necessary to determine how long a\nlist your budget can support.\nAs we noted above, it isn\u201ft difficult to set down the broad outlines of a budget. The\ntricky part is dealing with incidental and unanticipated expenses. The cost of materials can\nfluctuate dramatically (almost always upwards) and should be monitored throughout the\nplanning process. At the time of this writing, the cost of land, materials (especially steel), labor,\nequipment, fuel and petroleum-based products, and everything even remotely connected with\nfarming has been skyrocketing. Narrow vineyard tractors are pushing $40,000. Re-circulating\nsprayers can run upwards of $25,000. Add a pick-up truck or some flatbed delivery trucks and it\nis easy to go over budget.

Labor costs for a mature vineyard will make up at least 50% of your\noperating budget.\nEvery single purchase \u2013 from the vines to the tractor \u2013 will involve a decision about\nwhether to get the grade A, B, or C product. Grade A is always preferable because vineyards\nrepresent a long-term investment. If buying better equipment and materials threatens to break\nthe budget, then adjust the budget or vineyard size, not the quality of infrastructure. It is always\nadvisable to shop around for the best value but experience indicates that you get what you pay\nfor. Our advice is \u2013 Do not shave costs anywhere, just downsize as necessary.\nInvesting in quality\nThere are many visual indicators of a serious vineyard effort, such as stout deer fencing\nand metal training stakes. If an owner is willing to spring for these costs, it means that he\nunderstands the necessities of viticulture and the value of his crop. In deciding whether or not to\ninstall irrigation and other expensive add-ons, the costs should be analyzed in relation to the\nultimate value of the crop in the field, or perhaps the value of the wine. If you look at your\nbudget from this perspective the best approach is to protect your investment through quality\ncontrol. If you are simply selling your grapes (rather than also making wine), these extra costs\nmay be harder to justify, but remember that intangibles such as your reputation as a wine grower\nare at stake with every bit of control that you relinquish.\nTrickle down vineyard economics\nVineyards are expensive projects to develop and maintain. It\u201fs important to have a\nrealistic view of the overall economic demands. First, the type, style and price point of the wine\nmust be determined. The grower-winery owner should be well aware of the presence of a glass\nceiling on the price of wines in the East. The ceiling is especially difficult to penetrate for super\npremium quality wines. Currently, the best red wines are able to command $40, sometimes up to\n37\n$50 or more. Rare exceptions exist for very limited production wines. Given the harsh financial\ndemands on vineyard development and operations to grow these wines, a careful cost and market\nanalysis should be performed to see if such wines are practical, at least for now. The market for\nEastern wines is still evolving and eventually well-heeled consumers may acknowledge their\nquality by opening their wallets. It is a sensible exercise to work backwards from the targeted\nbottle price to the recovery costs for the business and the annual operating expenses to see if they\ncan offer a reasonable balance and bottom line. At low yields, especially for high quality red\nwines, the economics are daunting, even in well-established wine regions. As with every other\naspect of this business, the challenge is greater here in the East.\nIf a great wine is your final objective, then you should consider how wines are rated, for\nexample by the 100-point rating systems of The Wine Advocate or The Wine Spectator, and how\nscores may impact bottle price. Good wines in the 80-89 point range command a reasonable\nprice, but a disproportionately large effort and expense is required to achieve a score of 90 and\nevery single point above this threshold.

At the same time, your ROI could increase significantly\nas your wine climbs the point scale, motivating you to go the extra distance for quality. There\nare specific vineyards in the East that can help as models for this type of vineyard project.\nMarketing\nMany new growers do not seriously consider how they will market their grapes until the\nmoment arrives to sell them. It takes a while, but the grapes will arrive and they need to find a\nhome in a tank or barrel. You may still be a few years away from selling grapes, but it is not too\nearly to start thinking about who will be buying your grapes and/or wines. Marketing wine\ngrapes must begin with a good, hard look at a map of the wineries in your state and in the\nsurrounding region: these are your potential customers. Find out what wines they are making\nand successfully selling and how you might fit into their grape portfolio and business plan.\nIn the East, wine is mostly a local, small-business industry, and almost all wine is sold at\nfull retail from tasting room outlets. This arrangement offer great advantages up to a certain size\nof business. Because sales are mostly retail, the winery retains the full value of its product. This\nprovides an economic advantage over those in the wholesale market, who may be selling at only\nhalf of full value. In the West, wineries rely on a three-tiered wholesale market and make about\n50 cents on the dollar. In the Pennsylvania state stores, the markdown is also about 50% on local\nwines. Therefore only the bigger wineries can afford to enter the wholesale and out-of-state\nmarkets, and in the East they have done so with only limited success (this is one reason why\nwine drinkers have the impression that wine is only produced in California, Oregon and\nWashington).\nWherever your vineyard is located, you must consider who will be buying your wine and\nwhat their preferences are. The wine market can be roughly divided into two sectors \u2013 sweet and\ndry \u2013 with dry wine aficionados tending to live in the city and sweet wine enthusiasts in rural\nareas. A generalization often borne out in tasting rooms in the East is that people will \u201ctalk dry\nand drink sweet\u201d. Red wines usually sell for more than whites, but white wines are processed\nmore quickly and can alleviate cash flow problems. Indeed, in many wine regions the high-end\nwines are propped up by the semi-sweet and sweet, value-priced wines. A market-savvy grower\non Long Island claims that the varietal distribution with the best return is 75% to 80% reds and\n20% to 25% whites. You, however, must seek the best possible balance based on local market\nconditions. Only a few Eastern wineries specialize in all or mostly vinifera (dry) wines and they\ntend to supply niche markets, usually close to a large city.\n38\nThe Cost of Planting One Acre of Vineyard in Pennsylvania\nAssumptions: One acre of cleared, ready to plant land.

The truck fee may be shared with other\nvineyards in the area using the laser planting service. This is a rough approximation of costs. It will vary greatly\nbased on current prices, vineyard design, options and many other unpredictable variables. For example, wider vine\nspacing will reduce vine numbers and a divided canopy may or may not reduce trellis costs. However, in this\nscenario, it would not be unwise to add 25% to this cost for inflation, incidental and the unexpected. In general, the\nmore demanding the site, the higher the development costs will be. Flat square fields are the easiest/cheapest. Steep,\nrocky, fields with uneven blocks are the most expensive. French hybrid vineyards are generally less expensive to\ndevelop than vinifera. A deer fence is no longer considered optional for a high quality vineyard. Drain tile will\ndepend on soil evaluation.

Begin by looking at what your neighbor\ngrows and manages to sell. If there are no vineyards nearby, then do the necessary research to\ndetermine what varieties have the best market potential. Ideally, in a given region a consensus\nbetween viticulture, marketing and personal taste will form and a single varietal wine, such as\nPinot Noir in Burgundy or Nebbiolo in Piedmont, will emerge. The Eastern wine industry has a\nregional identity of sweet native and hybrid wines.

The\naftermath to the airing of \u201cThe French Paradox\u201d on the television program 60 Minutes presents a\nstriking case in point. This episode discussed the thesis that the consumption of red wine by the\nFrench might be helping to offset the negative effects of their high cholesterol diet. After the\nshow was broadcast, the market flipped from 2/3 white and 1/3 red to the opposite almost\novernight.\nThe best and easiest solution is to work with an estate winery, where you simply hand the\ngrapes off to them. Independent vineyards should strive to develop a broad, reliable and longterm customer base. One sure-fire formula is to grow high-quality grapes and negotiate the\nhighest possible prices for them. In all but the most saturated markets, outstanding grapes will\nalways be in demand and winemakers have a sixth sense as to which vineyards grow the best\ngrapes. When developing a marketing plan, you must also take into account how far your grapes\nor wines will have to travel to get to their markets. You certainly want to keep your\ntransportation and shipping costs to an absolute minimum.\nAll of these considerations must be taken into account in your decision regarding what\nvarieties to plant. It is by no means too early to determine who your customers will be and what\nvarieties, clones and wine styles are in demand. These market realities should then be balanced\nagainst the viticulture requirements of the site and your own goals for the vineyard. Remember\nthat your grapes or wine must be sold at a price that can support the quality of viticulture\nrequired to produce that wine.\nIf grapes are in short supply in your region, one option worth exploring is to make\narrangements with local wineries to plant the varieties they need and share the development\ncosts. A winery might, for example, pay for the vines in exchange for a multiple-year assurance\nof access to the fruit. This will create a relationship of close interdependence so reflect carefully\nbefore you make any such agreement.\nThe dollars and cents of development costs\nThe costs of establishing a vineyard will vary depending on land prices, site challenges,\nvine density, labor, trellis and equipment costs, and a myriad of other, often unpredictable\nexpenses. For a hybrid vineyard, expect to spend about $5,000 to $10,000 per acre in\ndevelopment costs. For a top-quality vinifera vineyard, one of our growers says that the\nminimum development cost is $15,000 per acre (not including land, irrigation, deer fence or\ndrain tile) and high-density vineyards may exceed $25,000 per acre. This is the investment\nrequired to make a vineyard appear on a piece of property, including materials, labor and\nservices. High quality consulting services may add significantly to the overall cost.\n40\nIt may be a practical and helpful exercise to work backwards from the expected grape or\nestate wine prices to determine how feasible an economic model is for your vineyard. The\neconomics of a vineyard requires something that goes against the grain in our current culture, i.e.\na long-term perspective.

Most development expense models predict an ROI horizon of 7-12\nyears for high quality vinifera grapes, less for hybrids. If a winery is involved, it pushes out even\nfurther. This will test the financial patience of even the most stalwart grower, who will have to\ntake the long investment view that the vineyard will give back much more than just financial\nrewards, and will eventually be passed on to the next generation.\nSize was discussed earlier in terms how much vineyard can be afforded, there is also the\nquestion of what size can be managed? The general rule is that one person can manage five\nacres full-time, or two to three acres part-time. Above ten acres you are going to need some\nexperienced full-time help. How many acres will support a family of four? Take a 10-acre\nChardonnay vineyard; at 2007 grape prices of $1300/ton x 4 tons/acre, it would have yielded a\ngross revenue of $5200/acre. Deduct $2500 to $3000 for operating expenses and then multiply\nby the number of acres you need to sustain your current lifestyle. It\u201fs here that the day job shows\nits value and the unquantifiable value-added allure of wine enters the picture.\nAs a grower, understanding the relationship between bottle and grape prices may help to\nnurture a better business relationship between vineyard and winery. In the 1950s, the Christian\nBrothers Winery and later Robert Mondavi adopted a 100 times bottle price formula for the cost\nof a ton of grapes, i.e. the grapes that go into a $10 bottle of Chardonnay should be valued at\n$1000 per ton. This formula is still widely used as a measure for setting fair prices between\ngrowers and wineries.\nTo set up or not to set up a winery\nNumbers like these explain why many growers eventually become winery owners. With\nstagnant grape prices, constantly rising costs, and the difficulty of cutting fat and achieving\ngreater efficiencies, it is becoming increasingly difficult to justify the economics of growing\ngrapes alone. Real profitability lies in the value-added wine product. However, this is not\nsufficient reason to start a winery and the decision to do so should not be driven by economic\nnecessity. Wineries are even more expensive to build than vineyards, and selling wine will take\nyou into a completely different business. The better you understand the economics of both grape\ngrowing and wine making, the less you will be tempted to take unwise risks.\nThe economics of a vineyard are worked out in reverse based on the FOB price of the\nbottle, because the bottom line is determined by wine sales, whether you are selling your grapes\nor form part of an estate winery.

In\nmany situations, a fundamental strategic change is necessary to make the business viable for the long haul.\nA good online resource for developing a business plan can be found at http://www.bizplanit.com.\n42\ncaution, and certainly not taken as a quick way out of a financial corner if your vineyard is not\nprofitable or you cannot sell your grapes.\nStarting a winery as an afterthought often results in the vineyard becoming the poor stepchild\nof the business and a victim of \u201cwinery disease.\u201d Resources including time, money and attention\nwill inevitably be channeled to the winery, and the vineyard \u2013 despite its importance to the\nsuccess of the entire enterprise \u2013 will take a backseat to the more romantic business of making\nand selling wine. Beware of this syndrome \u2013 the vineyard must be treated as an equal, if not\nmore valuable partner in the wine production stream.\nRunning a business\nBusiness considerations are not usually what motivate a person to get into grape growing,\nbut they are absolutely crucial to the success of the enterprise. Having a detailed business and\ndevelopment plan in place from the beginning makes the same sense for a vineyard as it does for\nany other business enterprise. It provides a map to evaluate costs relative to progress as the\nvineyard moves through the development process. Large or small, the goal should be to produce\na high-quality product. Professionals in the industry have grown weary of growers who treat the\nvineyard as a hobby and grow only mediocre fruit.

It isn\u201ft hard to be passionate about the vineyard but also\ntreat it as a business. If you do so, you and others will take it more seriously.\nOne of the benefits of this approach will be better recordkeeping. Many aspects of\nrunning a vineyard \u2013 from keeping track of the plant material to climate data, harvest\nmeasurements, yield records, etc. \u2013 depend on accurate and methodical recordkeeping. If\nsomething happens to affect the crop, an insurance company will request the historic harvest\nyield records. As more government regulations are imposed in the area of agriculture, it is\nimportant to keep detailed records of the vineyard\u201fs activities, including pesticide and fertilizer\nuse. Employers are increasingly expected to collect employment and payroll information.\nThe golden rule for a new vineyard is to start small, focus on quality, and grow into the\nproject. The first full grape crop may be 3 to 4 years away and the wine another 1 to 2 years.\nRecouping the initial investment is therefore at least 7 to 10 or more years away. Patience and\ngood financial planning are crucial to survive the lean early years.\nA helping hand financially\nThere is a saying in the wine industry that in order to make a small fortune you must start\nwith a large one. There is some truth to this, but not everyone with a passion for wine has a\nfortune to invest. For those who do not, there are a few sources of credit that they can turn to.\nThe loan and grant opportunities in agriculture are similar to those for most small businesses.\nThere are banks and credit associations such as Farm Credit that specialize in agricultural loans.\nIt would be wise to seek out a lender with agricultural experience, because he or she understands\nthe particular challenges that face farmers.\nState and federal agencies are very interested in developing the economies of rural areas and\nthere are some grants and low-interest loans available for farms. Such grants are usually quite\nspecific in their terms, so make sure that any you apply for are tailored to your needs. Contact\nyour state Department of Agriculture or your county\u201fs USDA Farm Service for details regarding\nsuch opportunities.\n43\nAs always, you can turn to your regional growers association and experienced vineyard\nowners for advice and information. In Maryland, to encourage vineyard expansion and meet the\ngrowing demand for wine grapes in the state, the wine industry in conjunction with the\nDepartment of Agriculture is offering a vineyard planting subsidy designed to assist new growers\nwith development costs. Tobacco settlement funds are helping wine growers in states like\nKentucky and North Carolina.

Be pleasantly surprised if you meet\nor beat your budget.\nStart small and grow into the business, with a modular plan to guide vineyard expansion.\nQuality always trumps quantity.\nDo not skimp on quality materials or methods and do not take short cuts.\nHave fun. Remember why you wanted to have a vineyard in the first place.\nAn alternative view on starting vineyard size from Ed Boyce at Black Ankle Vineyard in\nMaryland:\n\u201cI disagree about starting small. Small just means you are locked into a money-losing\nenterprise, because the economies of scale in a vineyard are huge. The only people who\nshould start small are very rich people who want to experiment first so when they do it\nbig they can get it right; in that case I\u2019d advise hiring a vineyard consultant and a really\ngood winemaking consultant and skip the experimenting. I think our focus on small\nvineyards is killing us. If someone can\u2019t start big (10 acres or more), then don\u2019t start.\nPlus, if you start big, you have no choice but to treat it like a business (employees, etc.)\nand not a hobby.\u201d\n44\nChapter 9\nImportant Viticulture Concepts and Principles\nGrowing wine grapes is a goal-oriented endeavor. It is important to define your\nobjectives and then develop strategies to reach them based on an understanding of the underlying\nissues. Throughout the process, first and foremost you should be asking why something is being\ndone, as well as the what, how and when. Good growers are always checking their motives and\nlogic by asking \u201ewhy\u201f any particular decision is made. For example, why should a steel stake be\npreferred over treated wood? Is it because of durability, availability, cost, or ease of installation?\nWhy is 8\u201f x 4\u201f spacing preferred over 9\u201f x 5\u201f and does it really make a difference? This is a\nbusiness where the pros and cons of every aspect of viticulture and vineyard development must\nbe weighed, and the best option chosen based on the results of your site evaluation.\nWine by its very nature and history is steeped in tradition. A lot of wine mythology is in\nservice to the romantic, cultural importance of the beverage. On the production side, it\u201fs\nimportant to realize that traditional practices exist for a reason and most have stood the test of\ntime.

But technology can only take a wine so far up the\nquality scale and eventually traditional methods must be blended back to bring an artisan quality\nto a wine. The proportion of new and old methods depends on the type of wine being produced\nand the best growers consider all of their viticultural options. New growers should be aware of\nthe influence of tradition on viticulture and not subscribe to an idea or practice just because\n\u201cthat\u201fs the way it has always been done\u201d or because that\u201fs how the neighbor does it. Basic\nviticulture adheres to the same principles in most wine regions in the world but it is up to the\nindividual grower to learn what technology and practices are best suited for any vineyard site to\nmake it perform to its full potential.\nA vineyard should be located, planned and designed to achieve the highest quality that\nconditions will allow, and most properly designed vineyards do in fact perform well under ideal\nvintage conditions. It is the less than ideal vintages that put a vineyard to the test and the best\nvineyards will show their strengths when challenged by sub-optimal conditions. Given the\nrealities of rainfall, humidity, frost, and winter temperatures in the East every site has plenty of\nopportunities to shine or fail. Identify the problems posed by your area and site, design your\nvineyard to meet these challenges, and your vines will be more consistent producers of highquality wines.\nSite selection and favorable soil and climate properties can make all the difference. Seek\nout any advantages that will mitigate the known challenges to quality of the region; these include\nwell-drained soils, rain shadows, open fields (for cross breezes), and favorable slopes, aspect,\nand elevation. Optimizing these factors can increase the chances that a fine wine will be\nproduced even in a difficult vintage. Good places to grow wine grapes may range from a shale\nsoil on a southwest slope in the Lehigh Valley to a rocky soil in the orchard-covered hills of\nAdams County; wine growers must find such sites and exploit them to their maximum potential.\nThe balanced vine\nVines exist in all sizes, shapes, colors and conditions. Within certain generally accepted\nparameters, the viticultural goal is to achieve a balanced vine with a specific size and shape.\nShould it be a vine that is only allowed to grow waist high, as they do in Bordeaux, or one that is\ntrained over your head on a pergola, as in some areas in Italy or Spain?\n45\nIn its essence, viticulture is something growers should not want to practice. If a utopian\nvine in perfect balance is considered, it requires no manipulation to achieve its ideal form and\nfruit quality. Much of viticulture is the band-aid that growers apply to a vine that is outside of\nthese utopian boundaries. The amount of intervention required is usually inversely proportional\nto the flaws of the site, or failure to design a vineyard appropriate to the site. So the better the\nsite, appropriate to wine goals, the less work and inputs will have to be made to produce ideal\nfruit. A good site, like a good vintage, makes making wine almost easy and fun! It makes sense\nto aggressively and intelligently pursue a good vineyard site for almost every conceivable\nbusiness and viticultural reason.

A balanced vine\nwill require less manipulation to achieve your wine style goals and under proper conditions will\nyield fully mature fruit at harvest.\nHaving an idea of the vine shapes and sizes you want will help you to make better wine.\nA good exercise is to take your viticultural objectives and then try to imagine a perfect vine on\nyour site. Will it be a \u201cbig\u201d vine that produces 10 or 20 pounds of fruit or a smaller one\nproducing 2 to 3 pounds? How much space will it need and what would be the best training and\ntrellis system? A perfect vine has just enough space on the trellis to spread out, filling it\ncompletely but not infringing on its neighbor\u201fs space; shoots that will grow to the top of the\ncanopy and stop growing around veraison; and just enough fruit set so that thinning is not\nnecessary but all the fruit gets fully ripe. With a picture of the ideal vine on your site, many of\nthe design features necessary to achieve this will come into clearer focus.\nOne of your early challenges will be to predict vine size before the vine is planted. In\nsome regions this is easy to do just by looking at your neighbor\u201fs vines. But in most of the East,\nwith a few exceptions like Long Island, vineyards are too far apart to learn from a neighbor. In a\nnew wine region, site assessment will be an important part of the discovery process. Think of\nthe soil as an engine with a finite amount of kinetic energy (fertility) waiting to be released\nthrough the vine. Water and nutrients are the fuels that drive growth. If it\u201fs a supercharged V-12\nyou\u201fll have a big vine, but if it\u201fs a four-banger you get a smaller vine. One visual example is a\nThompson Seedless vine on 12\u201f x 8\u201f spacing in the Central Valley of California versus a\nChardonnay vine on 3\u201f x 3\u201f in the Cote d\u201fOr. Why does one vine require 100 ft2 and the other\nonly 10 ft2\nand is one better than the other? Not in the eyes of their growers. Each is ideally\nadapted to its terroir and wine style objectives. The goal is to have a balanced vine, no matter\nwhat its size. In addition, growers should strive for a healthy and productive vine, which does\nnot necessarily mean a big one. A small vine on depleted soils can be healthy despite the fact\nthat it must work harder to access water and nutrients. To a large degree, the site will dictate\nyour decision, but there are also tools that can be used to manipulate the vine\u201fs structure and\nperformance.\nThere are numerical indices of vine balance (shoot length and diameter, inter-node\nlength, shoot distribution, lateral length, etc.; see Dr. Richard Smart in Sunlight into Wine),\nalthough these are difficult to apply to young vines.

Vine\n46\nphysiologists measure balance as an ideal ratio of 12-15 cm\n2\nof leaf surface area per gram of fruit\non a vine. This is a difficult formula for a grower to visualize. Balance to an experienced\ngrower is best viewed in a three dimensional canopy and accurate crop estimate at veraison.\nThese are difficult concepts for the novice wine grower to understand but critical parameters\nmust be determined in order to design and work towards vine balance.\nWorking with the terroir\nWhatever the size and shape of the vine, we are trying to achieve harmony between the\nvine and its environment. It is a complex phenomenon, but what can be said with certainty is\nthat every vineyard has its own terroir, whether good, bad or indifferent, and the terroir will\nleave its imprint on the wine. Each grower must strive to obtain, understand, and then to\ncultivate and preserve good terroir.\nYou can harness the terroir of your vineyard to your best advantage by making intelligent\nchoices. For example, it is difficult to manipulate the soil conditions, but you can choose a\nparticular soil to plant your vines depending on the style and type of wine you are aiming for.\nYou cannot influence the macroclimate, but you can pick a warmer or cooler site and optimize\nthe conditions to some degree by selecting the best elevation, aspect and amount of slope. The\nvariety, clone and rootstock, and the quality of your vine materials are other factors that will\ninteract with your terroir. Finally, viticulture is your personal input into the system, your\nfootprint in the vineyard and your fingerprints on the wine. Among all these components, which\nis the most important? One of our most experienced wine growers said that, if forced to choose,\nhe would rather have outstanding viticulture than an outstanding site. As an industry, much\nmore is known about viticulture than site selection, although that will certainly change over time.\nSmall artisan producers known as garagistes (garage wine makers) in Bordeaux have\ndemonstrated the importance of viticulture, taking hitherto unappreciated properties and\nsqueezing surprisingly fine wines from them using rigorous viticultural practices. At this time in\nthe evolution of the Eastern wine industry, the best sites have not yet been identified, so\nviticulture is necessarily the most important factor in the terroir equation.\nBig vine: old California sprawl system in Napa At Robert Mondavi, crew foreman Juan Martinez\namong the small vines, close spacing in Carneros\n47\nVine Physiology and Grape Quality\nCornelius (Kees) van Leeuwen, Viticulturist\nChateau Cheval Blanc, St Emilion\nBordeaux, France\nFor most agricultural crops, growers are looking to maximize yields or dry matter production on a\nper hectare basis.

Around the world in vineyards producing high\nquality wines, yields are often closer to 10 T / ha, sometimes even lower. Producing about three times less\nthan you could is not necessarily economic nonsense in wine production, because in no other crop is\nquality so well paid for as in viticulture. The price of a kilogram of grapes can easily range from $0.50 to\n$5 depending on its potential for producing quality wines.\nWine quality is generally optimized when vines meet some sort of stress, particularly for the\nproduction of red wines. The stress that is most frequently met in vineyards is water deficit stress. Water\ndeficit stress can occur in dry farmed vineyards, but also in irrigated vineyards where water can be\nwithhold in some part of the season to enhance quality potential. How is it possible that water-stressed\nvines produce better wines than unstressed vines? Water stress profoundly modifies vine physiology.\nSome of these modifications have negative consequences for quality potential, while others have positive\nones. Water stress reduces photosynthesis, i.e. the transformation of CO2 into sugar in the chloroplasts\nthat are mainly located in the leaf blades. Hence, dry matter production is reduced with negative\nimplications on yield. However, water stress also provokes shoot growth cessation, reduces berry size and\nenhances the synthesis of polyphenols. When shoot growth stops before veraison, a greater percentage of\nthe sugar produced by photosynthesis is available for the ripening of the berries. When berries are small, a\nsmaller amount of sugar is needed to increase the concentration of sugar in the grape juice. Polyphenols\nare quality components in red wine production, even more so than sugars. Finally, when water deficit\nstress is moderate the positive effects (shoot growth cessation, small berries, polyphenol synthesis)\noutweigh the negative effects (reduction of photosynthesis). Thus, quality potential is enhanced.\nThis mechanism explains why in the Old World, soils with high quality potential for red wine\nproduction are soils with moderate to low soil water-holding capacity, because they are shallow or stony.\nIn the New World, where vineyards are often planted in very dry climates, irrigation is in most cases used\nto obtain economically sustainable yields. However, in these regions great improvements in quality have\nbeen obtained over the last decade by implementation of the concept of deficit irrigation.\nWhen the climate is rainy, or when soils have a very high water holding capacity, it is sometimes\nvirtually impossible to obtain water deficit, even without any irrigation. In these situations growers can\nsuccessfully produce white wines. Grapes for high quality white wines are better if they contain few\npolyphenols, and water deficit stress is not as crucial as it is in red wine production. It can even be\ndetrimental to quality because it provokes aroma losses. If a grower intends to produce a high quality red\nwine in a situation where water deficit stress is not easily attained, he can look for another sort of stress.\nLimited nitrogen availability has similar effects to water deficit stress: reduction in shoot growth (rarely\ntotal inhibition), reduction of berry size, and enhancement of polyphenol synthesis.

This is not necessarily the case in viticulture, when one intends to grow high quality wines. Vines\ncan easily yield 30 tons of grapes per hectare. Around the world in vineyards producing high quality wines, yields\nare often closer to 10 T / ha, sometimes even lower. Producing about three times less than you could is not\nnecessarily economic nonsense in wine production, because in no other crop is quality so well paid for as in\nviticulture. The price of a kilogram of grapes can easily range from $0.50 to $5 depending on its potential for\nproducing quality wines.\nWine quality is generally optimized when vines meet some sort of stress, particularly for the production\nof red wines. The stress that is most frequently met in vineyards is water deficit stress. Water deficit stress can\noccur in dry farmed vineyards, but also in irrigated vineyards where water can be withhold in some part of the\nseason to enhance quality potential. How is it possible that water-stressed vines produce better wines than\nunstressed vines? Water stress profoundly modifies vine physiology. Some of these modifications have negative\nconsequences for quality potential, while others have positive ones. Water stress reduces photosynthesis, i.e. the\ntransformation of CO2 into sugar in the chloroplasts that are mainly located in the leaf blades. Hence, dry matter\nproduction is reduced with negative implications on yield. However, water stress also provokes shoot growth\ncessation, reduces berry size and enhances the synthesis of polyphenols. When shoot growth stops before\nveraison, a greater percentage of the sugar produced by photosynthesis is available for the ripening of the berries.\nWhen berries are small, a smaller amount of sugar is needed to increase the concentration of sugar in the grape\njuice. Polyphenols are quality components in red wine production, even more so than sugars. Finally, when water\ndeficit stress is moderate the positive effects (shoot growth cessation, small berries, polyphenol synthesis)\noutweigh the negative effects (reduction of photosynthesis). Thus, quality potential is enhanced.\nThis mechanism explains why in the Old World, soils with high quality potential for red wine production\nare soils with moderate to low soil water-holding capacity, because they are shallow or stony.

The challenge is to predict how size and balance can be achieved in\na particular terroir.\nStressing your vines\nIf you pay close attention to vintage quality in Europe and other non-arid regions, you\nwill observe a relationship between the weather in a particular vintage and the quality of the\nwines. As a general rule, warm, dry years produce very fine wines whereas cool, wet years\nproduce lesser quality wines.

A vine\u201fs vegetative imperative will be expressed if it has sufficient sun, water and\nnutrients to satisfy its basic needs. Under these conditions, however, its reproductive nature and\nthe production of fruit become secondary. Only when the vine feels threatened will its\nreproductive need come into focus and direct resources toward seed production. The goal of\nproducing ripe fruit is to attract a bird or other creature, which will eat the berry and deposit the\nseeds where they can grow and ensure the perpetuation of the species.\nTherefore, the vine\u201fs desires may be at odds with our wine making goals, which are to\nhave very ripe grapes every year, even when the vine is feeling comfortable and stress-free.\nHow to induce the vine to change its physiological behavior is one of the great challenges of\ngrowing wine in a wet climate. In California and other arid regions the solution is simple: to\nstress a vine into the reproductive mode the vineyard manager can just flip a switch and withhold\nirrigation water. Almost immediately the vine will sense the lack of water and produce a\nbiochemical signal. In response, resources will be diverted from producing more leaves to\nripening its seeds. This is what we want as wine growers!\nThere are certain times in the growing season when mild water stress is desirable.\nShortly after fruit set to limit berry size and just before and after veraison to help push fruit\nripening. Not so much stress that the vine wilts or photosynthesis is hampered, but enough to\nslow growth (which can be seen in the slowing or termination of shoot growth). Unfortunately,\nthe Eastern U.S. receives even more rainfall, and the possibility of hurricanes and low pressure\nsystems during the critical months of September and October than regions with a similar climate\nsuch as Bordeaux and Burgundy.\nGrowers should try to understand the relationship between the soil, water and the vine in\norder to regulate growth, particularly during the most critical periods. There is a delicate balance\nto be maintained, because the notion that vines must \u201esuffer\u201f to produce good fruit is not a hard-\n49\nand-fast rule and exaggerated in the popular wine media. There are times during the growing\nseason when mild water stress will help to regulate berry size and hasten fruit maturity, but vines\nshould never be nutrient and-or water deficient.\nUniformity and synchronicity\nAlong with vine size and balance, uniformity and synchronicity are key goals in\nviticulture \u2013 within and between vines and even down to the individual berries in a cluster. In\nthe simplest terms, winemakers want uniform fruit with the same optimal maturity parameters in\nevery berry. Achieving uniformity, however, is a terrific challenge.

Vines of different ages never ripen at the same rate,\nwhich increases variability and open trellis is uneconomical. A consistently uniform vineyard is\nmore difficult to achieve in Eastern growing conditions than more accommodating climates.\nA uniform vineyard is a pleasure to see. Building uniformity in the vineyard means\ndeveloping \u201csameness\u201d in all aspects of the vineyard, but this does not imply eliminating the\ndistinctive characteristics of a site. It should be noted that there are fine wine growers who\nbelieve that non-uniformity, to a degree, will contribute to the complexity of a wine and, in fact,\nis what makes individual wines unique. Certainly there are differences among terroirs. The\nquest for uniformity generally resides within a defined zone of terroir. But this is certainly a\ntopic that is subject to debate and different viticultural approaches.\nYour goal is to produce fruit of uniform ripeness along all parts of the vine and within the\nseparate sections (defined by the variety, clone, rootstock, or other terroir features) of the\nvineyard. In a perfect world every grape in a block of vines would ripen to the same brix level\nbut berries at the bottom of the cluster will ripen faster than those at the top, and clusters on the\nnorth or east side of a vine will ripen more slowly than those with a southern or western\nexposure. This variability makes winemaking more complicated because acid, pH, flavors,\nphenolics and other quality components become jumbled. It also makes the task of accurately\nsampling vineyards more difficult. On the other hand, a fine line must be drawn on the matter of\nuniformity, because we want to celebrate the differences and uniqueness of terroir and not\nhomogenize it.\nUniformity may exist in consistent and regular soil and climate features across a vineyard\nsite. These are often the easiest and most predictable vineyards to farm and make wine. Once\nvariability is introduced, only careful site evaluation use precision viticulture tools and\ntechnologies, can help to build greater uniformity into a site. Once the vineyard is planted,\nviticultural practices can be used to enhance uniformity.\nUniformity is prized in specific blocks where a defined style of wine is expected. Of\ncourse, there will be variability as the mesoclimate, the soil, and the microclimate of individual\nvines shifts across a vineyard. These factors all go into defining the terroir. Achieving\nuniformity begins with careful site analysis and vineyard design. After the vines are planted,\npractices such as training and pruning can be employed to create vine uniformity. Viticulture\ntools such as rootstocks, training systems, artificial drainage, irrigation, etc. can enhance the\nuniformity between sections of the vineyard. Precision viticulture makes use of a variety of tools\nto analyze, define and develop uniformity in a vineyard, including sophisticated soil pit and\n50\nelectromagnetic induction analysis, geographic positioning systems (GPS), geographic\ninformation systems (GIS) for mapping purposes, aerial photography and more.

This means that each\nphysiological process, such as flowering, veraison, and fruit ripening, will unfold across a\nvineyard or a block of vines at the same time, leading to even results. Bud break that takes place\nsynchronously in a block of vines holds out the promise that the fruit will reach maturity at the\nsame time. Within clusters berries that ripen together usually leads to better wines. Wide\nvariations in ripeness between berries, clusters, vines, or blocks of vines can reduce the quality of\nthe wine. Nevertheless, you will have to face the fact that the cooler the site, the more difficult it\nis to achieve consistent synchronicity of ripening.\nManaging vine size, keeping the vine\nin balance, and maintaining a healthy vine\nwill promote ripeness of the fruit and wood,\nour two most important goals. If the\nvineyard can be designed and managed to\nachieve full fruit maturity, then proper\nmaturation of the wood usually follows and\nyou will be able to count on long-term\nsustainability and profitability, and the\nsuccess of the vineyard.\nPowering the vineyard: sunlight and nutrients\nThe role of light and temperature in all vine physiological processes, and especially in\nfruit maturation cannot be overestimated. This is a top consideration in choosing a site and\ndesigning a vineyard. Sunlight powers photosynthesis and the production of sugars and\ncarbohydrates, which are essential ingredients in fruit ripening, development of cold hardiness\nand fuel for shoot growth. The ambient air and soil temperature wakes the vines up in the spring\nand drives the biochemical reactions that push fruit towards maturity. There are physiological\nreasons why cool years are often late and difficult, and why wine growers pray for warmer\nvintages, which offer greater uniformity, synchronicity and ripeness to the fruit. Between\nveraison and harvest, temperature is critical to the development of the flavor, aroma, and\nphenolic compounds that are characteristic of the grape variety and appreciated by wine\nconsumers and critics. Viticultural factors such as row direction, trellis design, and canopy\nmanagement all have an impact on the microclimate characteristics that affect fruit maturation.\nLike light, nutrients (especially nitrogen) have the effect of encouraging vegetative\ngrowth in vines, which may be large or small, but in each case too much of a good thing will\nmake a \u201efat vine\u201f, i.e. with lots of wood and little fruit. Excessive quantities of water and\nnutrients do not lead to fine wines.

Nitrogen should be monitored in the grape must as well, to be sure that there is\nan adequate supply in the soil and vine.\nWith agronomic crops the goal is to maximize yields, often forcing production by the use\nof copious amounts of water, fertilizer and pesticides. Fine wine growers must instead seek to\nbalance yields with quality. Especially when interpreting soil and plant tissue analysis results\nyou should be aware that general agronomic principles are usually based on field and row crops\n(such as corn, soybean, wheat, etc.) and are not necessarily transferable to vines. This is not to\nsay that they are irrelevant, but soil and nutrition principles should be applied with care in the\nvineyard, especially when interpreting soil tests. Viticulture is a sub-discipline of horticulture,\nwhich encompasses tree and small fruits, and vegetables. Horticultural information is usually\nmuch more transferable to viticulture. In a world overflowing with information, grape growers\nneed to be certain that what they seek, ingest and especially, what they use, is applicable to the\nexact needs of the vineyard.\nIn the vine balance equation, there is an optimal threshold for yield and quality.\nWinemakers usually want the highest-quality grapes possible, but it does not make economic\nsense to produce one less berry than the maximum possible at the predetermined quality\nstandard. Many wine makers and writers are compelled to push yields lower in a quest for ever\ngreater fruit concentration. This quality-quantity relationship is a regressive one and, at a lower\nthreshold, may have a detrimental effect on fruit quality. But why harvest 2.5 tons per acre if 3\ntons will reach the accepted quality threshold? The one-half ton difference translates into about\n400 bottles and that\u201fs a lot of wine not to produce or grapes not to get paid for. Each grower\nmust determine how he can optimize yield and quality for each variety in each block of vines.\nOnly through direct experimentation in the field can ideal yields for the desired type of wine be\naccurately determined.\nSoil nutrient levels must therefore be tailored to wine type and style objectives. If the\naim is the production of fighting varietals, then a more nutrient-rich soil is probably desirable. If\na very fine red wine is the target, then limiting nutrients and their availability is necessary. This\nusually means finding a soil that has low to moderate nutrient levels. It is always easier to add\nnutrients than to remove them so starting with lower than optimal levels is acceptable.\nCharacteristics such pH and cation exchange capacity can have important effects on nutrient\nuptake. If your goal is to grow a small vine with low yields, then you should look for soil with a\nlow to moderate pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and organic matter.

In grape growing you never get\nsomething for nothing and there are lateral and downstream effects to every decision that you\nmake. For example, if lowering the fruit wire to gain heat for ripening will reduce the airflow,\nwhich could lead to disease problems. Running rows up and down a slope will facilitate\nequipment operation and improve safety, but could take the rows out of their ideal orientation, as\nwell as increasing erosion problems. Planting vines at the top of a slope or hill offers greater\nprotection from frost and freezing, but the site will be cooler during the growing season and this\ncould slow ripening.\nThere are many ways to do the same thing which exacerbates the decision making\nprocess. Ten growers will have ten different suggestions on what kind of post to use and how to\ninstall it. It can get frustrating to sort through the options, but a best answer must be found based\non sound information. There is usually a better and a worse decision, and sometimes even a\nclear-cut right or wrong way to do something. Looking at the successful application of a\nsolution is always a good guide.\nThese complex interrelationships are what viticulture is all about and it is up to the\ngrower to achieve balance and harmony in his vineyard. How will you know when you have\nachieved viticultural utopia? Only the mature vine with fruit and, later, the wine will provide the\nanswer. In vino veritas is really true for the wine grower. However, you can use the guidelines\nof viticulturists such as Dr. Richard Smart to make sure that you are moving in the right\ndirection. The golden rules are expounded by him in Sunlight into Wine, a \u201emust read\u201f for every\nnew grower. Other expert viticulturists have their own criteria for ideal vine size, balance and\nharmony, which should be taken into consideration as well.\n53\nChapter 10\nSite Selection: The Single Most Important Decision a Grape Grower Will Make\nThe special and specific characteristics of the site, primarily soil and climate, will\ndetermine the quality of the wine harvested from it. There is no getting round this simple truth.\nIf great wine is the goal, a great site is necessary to grow it.\nThe challenge of choosing a site in the East\nThis manual is unabashedly biased\ntoward the production of high quality hybrid\nand vinifera wines, the best of which should\neventually compete at international standards\nof quality.

To date Eastern wine growers have struggled with late red\nvarieties, including Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Chambourcin. Correct site\nselection is the answer to this and to the many viticultural problems in our region.\nNew wine regions tend to adapt (or force) viticulture onto a substandard site. I advocate\na new paradigm which is to start by finding and planting the best vineyard sites. It always takes\ntime but with available GIS data and analysis and mapping technologies, accurate high quality\nsite assessment is possible. Of course, there is no substitute for \u201cground truthing\u201d results and\nonly by planting and making wine can the potential of a site be truly understood.\nThe selection of the vineyard site is the most important decision you will make. It should\nbe guided by goals set for the wine (type, style, price point, etc.), which will then influence all\nsubsequent viticultural decisions. For example, to grow grapes for \u201ebox, jug or fighting varietal\nwines\u201f a field with deeper, more fertile soils located outside of a frost zone would be desirable.\nIf the goal is a \u201eParker 95\u201f, the vineyard site requirements will be entirely different. Eastern\nwines quality is currently driven by a lack of high quality sites, and relies on viticulture as a\ncrutch to compensate for site deficiencies. The contribution of the site to wine quality will\nimprove as the optimal combinations of soils and climate are found. In the best vineyards in\nEurope the site leaves its distinctive mark or \u201ctypicity\u201d on a wine. It is thought-provoking to\nobserve just before harvest the rather messy canopies in a great vineyard in Medoc compared to\nthe fastidious care of a Jeff Newton vineyard in California where every shoot is individually\npositioned, yet the quality of wine from Bordeaux is consistently excellent. This is surely an\nexpression of vine balance in a great vineyard site. It is our mission to find the places that can\nachieve this rare quality of balance in terroir.\nCould this be a great vineyard site?\n54\nTypes and styles of wines usually follow the terroir from which they are extracted. Arid\nregions like California, South America and Australia tend to offer bolder wines that reflect the\nsun-drenched conditions which they are grown. It is not easy to force a variety to grow out of its\ncomfort range and that is why there is not Cabernet Sauvignon grown in the Mosel or Riesling is\nno longer considered suitable in Yountville. Some varieties are more flexible than others, but\nmost wine regions aspire to the wines that best express their unique terroir.\nCooler areas with variable climates produce quite a different kind of wine, which could\nbe described as a \u201eEuropean\u201f style: fresher, lighter, more elegant. Wine writers say that cooler\nregions such as Germany, Alsace and Burgundy are among the most expressive of their terroir.\nMuch of the Eastern U.S. is such a region, sometimes in the extreme; there are few areas in the\nworld with such variable and adverse conditions in terms of fine wine production. Too little sun\nand too much rain can push wine quality over the cliff in poor vintages such as 2009. This is\nwhy site selection is paramount in the East, because it offers the best hedge against harsh vintage\nconditions.

The smart wine grower prepares for difficult conditions by finding a site with\nmeritorious features and then backing them up with excellent viticulture during the growing\nseason.\nIn a survey of growers conducted for this manual, site selection was identified almost\nunanimously as the most important factor determining grape quality. There are few\naccomplished wine growers anywhere in the world who would dispute this assertion. In regions\nsuch as Bordeaux and Burgundy it seems that the growers know their soils better than their\nspouse or children. Here in the East we accept the principle, but still little is known about what\nconstitutes a good site to grow fine wine. We can state with confidence that great Riesling and\nGewurztraminer can be grown around the Finger Lakes, but we have not yet identified exactly\nwhere the best places are, much less the why they are special. It has been demonstrated that in\nthe Mid-Atlantic region Bordeaux reds can make delicious blended wines, but there is little\nconsensus on the ideal terroir. Until recently in the East few vineyard sites were chosen solely\non the basis of their wine-growing potential, so we have been working with a handicap when it\ncomes to making fine wines.\nThe process of site selection is a combination of science, art and intuition. When\nexperienced eyes see a vineyard site for the first time, they can almost taste the wine that will\ncome from it. That\u201fs an intuition that shouldn\u201ft be ignored but it must be based on local and\ninternational experience. What must validate intuition is a careful analysis, because vineyards\nare complicated systems and much of the terroir is not in view. Each vineyard is genuinely\nunique and requires careful analysis to understand. In fact, only after farming a particular\nvineyard for many years will its true nature be revealed. In well-established winemaking areas in\nEurope and even California something like a recipe may exist, but ultimately it comes down to\nplanting the vines and tasting the wines produced by a particular piece of ground.\nFor those who do not want to wait that long there are new technologies, such as the New\nYork Vineyard Site Evaluation System (see below), that allow you to analyze vineyard sites with\nremarkable precision using existing soil and climate information in a GIS database. Intelligently\napplied, such tools can help new growers to close the quality gap more rapidly than in the past,\nbut they can only push quality so far. Technology will never have the final say, because\nassessing the potential of a site requires walking over it, digging a hole to see what is underfoot,\nand learning how the climate above will affect the vines. The true quality of a site will only be\nrevealed over time by the vines.\n55\nA general rule that holds in cooler wine districts such as the East (perhaps definable as\nabove the Mason-Dixon line) is that warm and dry vintages make fine wine, while cool and wet\nyears are more challenging. Site selection is especially important for red wine grapes, which\ntend to be more demanding due to their generally later ripening periods (exceptions being Pinot\nnoir and the red hybrids). Therefore we want to maximize certain qualities in order to make the\nmost of less than ideal vintages. In a damp climate the need for specific characteristics such as a\nwarm site, well-drained soil and a drying breeze are absolutely vital, and these virtues cannot be\nover appreciated.

Site selection in the East is an ongoing learning process but is currently\nlimited to generic site selection rules that apply to vineyards everywhere.\nIn the East water is a precious and available commodity that wine growers spend a great\ndeal of time worrying about. Ill-timed rainfall can severely compromise wine quality. A soil\nthat drains poorly will retain moisture, which can lead to \u201cwet feet\u201d (where vines are stressed due\nto the lack of air in water-saturated soil) or to an overly vigorous vine that may suffer from\ndisease problems and does not allow the fruit to properly ripen. For these and many more\nreasons significant measures, both natural and artificial, will be needed to combat the harmful\neffects of excess water. The unfortunate irony is that water can also be scarce, which means that\nsometimes supplemental water is needed from an irrigation system, a costly expense. This is a\ntypical viticultural conundrum: you can\u201ft live with too much or too little water and \u2013 this being\nagriculture \u2013 all vineyards will experience both conditions.\nSite selection is a process where patience meets determination. It is daunting that the\nmost important decision a grape grower faces is among the very first that must be made. It will\ntake plenty of skill and luck to find the right place to grow the grapes for the intended wine.\nFortunately, there is a lot of information and experience to draw upon. You are not alone.\nLooking at other successful examples will help to inform and support the planning process. This\nneeds to be an information-rich process using data mined from all manner of sources. So learn\nthe basic principles, get sound advice, and remember that paying attention to the smallest details\nnow will reap significant benefits later.\nRdV in Virginia: SE-SW aspect, steep slopes, and rock all join together to\nmake a great vineyard site\n56\nVineyard Development Process for Coastal Vineyard Care Associates\nJeff Newton, Founder and Co-owner\nCoastal Vineyard Care Associates\nSanta Barbara County, California\nThe most important decisions in the history of a particular vineyard are those made before a vine is ever\nplanted \u2013 during the vineyard\u201fs planning process.

In my work I see far more sub-standard properties for wine\nthan fine ones \u2013 the discouraging fact is that high-quality vineyard sites are very rare and your\nproperty is likely to be a poor to mediocre place to grow high-quality wines. The question then\nswitches from \u201eWhat is the best place to start to make a fine wine?\u201f to \u201eHow can I make design\nand viticulture accommodate a weak site?\u201f The same viticulture principles apply to all sites, it\u201fs\njust that a good one demands far fewer inputs. You may have to resort to some compromises\nand \u201cband-aid\u201d measures to make up for site deficiencies, but with current technologies most\nsites can be adapted to grape culture \u2013 a poor soil can be ameliorated, a north slope can be\nplanted with white varieties, savvy variety and rootstock choices, and so on.\nWhen a wine region is mature, a definition for a fine vineyard site emerges. Outstanding\nvineyard sites do not just happen; they are identified after intensive research, and even then only\ntime will tell if a certain combination of soil and climate characteristics is suited for fine wine\nproduction.

Outstanding\nvineyard sites do not just happen; they are identified after intensive research, and even then only\ntime will tell if a certain combination of soil and climate characteristics is suited for fine wine\nproduction. The search can take one day or several years depending on the wine objectives. In\nPennsylvania, the best vineyard sites are probably located among the fruit trees in Adams County\nor the rolling, well-drained soils of York County. In most site selection situations, compromises\nare made and then the evaluation process will begin. In densely planted areas such as the North\nFork of Long Island, a sketch of what a quality vineyard looks like has emerged over time.\nTo aid in the search it is important that a specific list of site criteria be drawn up and\napplied to the selection process. This can be done with the help of a consultant and should be\nshared with an assisting farm realtor. Characteristics such as soil, local and regional climate,\nslope, aspect, elevation, local topography, water sources, and potential problems (proximity to\nwoods or neighbors, land use, utilities, zoning, buildings, etc.) will all come into play. One\nstrategy is to identify a successful vineyard and buy one nearby, but it is rare to find contiguous\nvineyards except in such areas as Long Island and the Niagara Peninsula.\nThe care taken in evaluating properties will help to lower the risk of acquiring a marginal\nsite. For example, slight changes in soil and topography can have a great impact on the vines.\nOne grower explained to me how in a rainy season it is always the vines in the lower sections of\nthe vineyard, or even in slight depressions in a vine row where soils may retain moisture or are\nmore fertile, that have more vigor or shut down later, resulting in greater disease or more winter\ninjury problems. In France cereal crops are planted in the low spots where the soil is too fertile\nand frost conditions prevail, while grapes are often found on gentle to steep slopes. There is a\nviticultural dynamic in every site that combines soil and climate conditions to good or poor\neffect. Good growers (or novices with their consultants) are able to observe and understand\nthese relationships and take advantage of or avoid them.\nThe most experienced growers in a region have a sense of where the best sites are located\nbased on their collective wisdom, and as you search for a site you would be well advised to\nconsult with them as well as local viticulture extension educators. A real estate agent who\nspecializes in agriculture can also be a helpful guide, although you should keep in mind that they\nare more accustomed to finding properties for agronomic or livestock use, so you must make\nclear distinctions that they can apply to the selection process. If you identify a general region for\nyour vineyard, they can find properties based on simpler criteria such as size and general\ntopography.\n58\nAt this point, you should already have a rough idea of what you can afford to spend on\nland.

Vineyard owners often have other sources of income that can help to prop up business\nplans, but even the most robust income can succumb to the weight of capital development costs.\nOnce money becomes an issue, the project loses much of its luster.\nThe initial evaluation of the site\nThe initial site survey can provide extremely valuable information. First impressions are\nimportant and will set the tone for the decisions to follow. Walk the property with a grower\nand/or consultant who has local experience to determine if any \u201cdeal breakers\u201d exist (e.g., wet\nsoils, frost hazards, poor aspect, too steep, EPA superfund site, etc). The potential of a site can\nbe quickly recognized from its physical features. Studying the local vegetation will shed light on\nqualities of the soil such as drainage and fertility. Features like slope, aspect, and local and\nabsolute elevations should also be critiqued. Walking a field after a heavy rain can reveal\ndrainage characteristics. Try to visualize the field planted with vines according to row direction,\nblock shape, size and position. What are the variables surrounding the field that will affect the\nvines (such as trees, hills, etc.). It is difficult to determine the exact \u201clay of the land\u201d when tall\ngrass, corn or other plants are growing, so in order to accurately assess the shape and contour of\na property it should be mowed before viewing.\nThe site history can form an important part of the property evaluation. This includes\ninformation on prior crops, livestock use, pesticides and fertilizers applied, water tables, hard\npans, mining, dumping and so on that will shed light on the present quality of the soil and its past\nmanagement. For example, if herbicides have been used recently, such as Atrazine on corn or\nPoast on soybean, some remediation work may be needed. Knowing crop yields may offer\ninsights into the productivity of the soils on the property. However, do not let prior crop use\nmislead you. In Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, where the soils are considered to be very\nfertile, corn and soybean reign supreme, but eroded hilltops with Bedington series soils have a\nhigh rock content and are well suited to wine grape production.\nVineyards promote a monoculture and it is tempting to focus solely on the needs of the\nvines, but the property is part of a larger ecosystem and site evaluation should be sensitive to\nthis. Farmers need to be ecologists and to assume the responsibilities with regard to the\nenvironment and its inhabitants that come with land stewardship. The concept of sustainability\nshould inform every development and management decision, including the selection of your site.\nLook at the vineyard not simply as rows of cultivated vines, but as a whole farm system that\nincludes a variety of habitats from watershed to riparian. Can you develop a vineyard with the\nsmallest possible impact on the natural ecology? If these concerns are addressed, it will be\npossible to dramatically reduce the imposition of the vineyard on its ecosystem.

It offers a chance to predict the\neventual size and balance of the vine. Soil evaluation is necessary once the property passes the\nwalkover inspection by a knowledgeable viticulturist. The best and most practical time in\nvineyard development to ameliorate the soil is before the vines and trellis are installed.\nTherefore, the soil chemistry, biology and physical features need to be carefully assessed at the\nbeginning of the development process. The physical features are very difficult to alter and\nattempting to do so often causes more damage than good. The soil chemistry on the other hand\nis more readily modified.\nThe problem with soil is that we only see the top of it, when it is what lies below that\nmatters most for the wine. There are few sites where the soil will be uniform in texture,\ndrainage, nutrient status and composition over a wide area. This lack of uniformity makes it a\nchallenge to understand what site-specific practices and actions are needed within the vineyard.\nSome useful facts about the nature of a soil can be extrapolated from surface features\n(topography,vegetation, rocks, drainage), but this is usually not enough information to tell us\nwhether a soil will be good for fine wine. In wet climates the soil matters even more for\nsuccessful wine growing.\nIs there a best soil for wine? This would be hard to define, because soil interacts with so\nmany other terroir components. There are types of soils that seem to produce fine wines around\nthe world, such as limestone-based and gravelly soils. Heavy clay soils, with a few exceptions\nlike the blue clay in Pomerol, are not usually identified with fine wine production. If great\nvineyards soils exist in the East, they still need to be identified, tested and mapped. Based on\nearly results the granite in northern Virginia, shale in southeast Pennsylvania, and gravel by Lake\nErie and the Finger Lakes appear to make excellent wines. This is a starting point, but only time\nand serious technical work in the vineyard and cellar will lead to a level of knowledge of Eastern\nsoils comparable to that of the French.\nIn the East, the quality of almost every vintage hangs on soil moisture \u2013 whether there is\ntoo much or too little of it (just right is a rare occurance). In the best vintages soil moisture will\nbe in a good balance with the vine and the winemaker\u201fs needs. It is quite hard to generalize\nabout something as complex as the soil\u2013water\u2013vine relationship, but in general soils good for\nviticulture are well-drained, warmer and lighter with larger aggregates. They may be gravelly or\nwith coarse rocks that lower the nutrient values and retain and release heat. These warm soils\npromote fruit maturity and an early harvest, valuable assets in a cool region. Cool soils are often\ndeep, fertile and moist, higher in clay and silt content, and do not warm as readily. In a drought\nyear cooler soils can help to maintain the vine.

It is important to\nremember that as far as soil moisture and nutrients are concerned, it is always easier to add than\nto remove them from the soil when you want to have an impact on the plant. Even though soil is\ncrucial to wine quality, most of its effects are indirect, influencing viticulture characteristics such\nas vine size and vigor.\nUnderstanding a soil begins with a walk over the field and looking at the surface\ncharacteristics, rocks, vegetation and indications of drainage or the lack of it. Grapevines prefer\nto have \u201cdry feet.\u201d Wet soils are cool and lack the oxygen that is essential to proper root\n60\nfunctioning. It is much easier to discern the physical features of a field if the vegetation is cut\nlow. A cornfield is very hard to interpret, although yield variations across a field may offer\ninsights into the soil.\nThe walkover should be followed by an examination of backhoe pits or soil cores by an\nexperienced soil viticulturist who can interpret the physical, chemical and biological properties\nof the soil relative to your wine goals. A complete soil analysis will include an organoleptic\nevaluation \u2013 sight, touch, smell and in some cases even taste to determine its viticultural\npotential. Chemistry may be the most familiar component since you probably have done a soil\ntest on your lawn, which generated a report with numbers and recommendations. The physical\ninterpretation of a vineyard soil is just as important, especially with regard to internal drainage,\nbut here the examination is more visual and textural. In our discussion of vine balance we\ncompared the soil to an engine that fuels vine processes.\nMaking use of soil tests\nSoil tests are essential if you want to understand the fundamental nature of a soil. The\nfact that they are so easy to conduct may tempt you to rely on them at the expense of physical\nproperties (structure and texture) when determining the worthiness of a site, so you should\nremember that: (a) the results are only as good as the sample that has been taken and its correct\ninterpretation, and (b) they only represent a snapshot of the conditions at the moment of\nsampling. Soil samples can reveal nutrient deficiencies, toxicity or other anomalies that may\nrender a property unsuitable for vines or that can be ameliorated. Soil tests highlight chemical\nproperties such as pH and cation exchange capacity, which influence nutrient uptake, and the\norganic components, all of which will have an impact on vine size and health.\nAll of these variables must be weighed and balanced to service the type of wine intended\nfor the site. The tests should be done prior to planting so there won\u201ft be any surprises later on,\nallowing for adjustments to an open field. These initial tests will also provide the all-important\nbaseline reference data for the vineyard\u201fs soil chemistry.

Test results are only useful if you get the right person to\nread and evaluate them, and this should ideally be a soil scientist with a clear understanding of\nviticulture and your wine goals. You can do the soil tests yourself, but you will probably be\nbetter off hiring a consultant to take the samples and provide a proper interpretation as part of the\nevaluation process. Soil samples can be analyzed by private laboratories such as A&L Eastern or\nland-grant university labs such as the one at Penn State or Cornell (a list of services is provided\nin the resources section). A facility with viticulture experience would be the best choice.\nSoil qualities\nTo produce high quality wine grapes, a soil of modest fertility is preferable, and low to\nmoderate pH, organic matter, and cation exchange capacity may be beneficial. Soil pH affects\nthe ability of roots to take up soluble nutrients. Soil pH in the East is generally acidic and\nsometimes drops into the fours, a range that is not ideal for vinifera vines. When the pH goes\nbelow 5, vines may have a problem with aluminum toxicity and phosphorus deficiency. Various\nforms of lime and gypsum can be used to adjust the pH upwards and the situation can also be\n61\nimproved by using the rootstock Gravesac, which is tolerant of low pH soils. For viticulture\npurposes a soil pH between 5.5 and 6.5 is optimal, and up to 7.5 is considered acceptable. In\nsome areas high-quality wine growers will aim for soils with a pH between 5.0 and 6.0 as a tool\nto regulate vine size by influencing nutrient uptake. If the pH goes above 7.5, vines may develop\niron chlorosis and zinc deficiency.\nHigh nitrogen levels can lead to excessive vine vigor and problems with vine balance.\nNitrogen is a particular troublesome nutrient since it can cause problems at both luxury and\ndeficient levels. Agronomists prefer soils rich in N because of their productivity for crops like\ncorn and soybean. But for grapes, it is critical to keep nitrogen at optimal levels in service of the\nwine \u2013 lower N for premium wines and higher amounts with increasing productivity. Be aware\nof soil test results, especially from labs that focus on agronomic crops that recommend large\ninputs of nitrogen. Like water, nitrogen can\nencourage too much vine growth, which has many\nnegative consequences for grape and wine quality.\nIn most matters of the vine, restraint is a better\nattitude than \u201cmore is better.\u201d It is almost always\neasier to add something later than to try to take it\naway.

Seek out\nspecific and viticulture-based recommendations for\nsoil amendments.\nSoil testing procedures\nAny soil test will come with specific instructions, but there is usually not a standard\nmethod for testing in vineyards. In general, taking mixed samples to obtain an aggregate profile\nof a field should be avoided. Since vine roots can go deep, it is helpful to determine how the\nchemistry changes with soil depth. For mapping and amelioration purposes, sampling across a\nfield should represent points and transitions from one sample site to the next. This is the best\nway to map a field and plan the necessary corrections to achieve uniformity.\nFarmers rarely worry about the soils below plow depth, but it is important for you to get a\ncloser and deeper look in order to determine the difference between farmed and natural soils in\nthe vineyard area. In Eastern wine growing, the physical characteristics of a soil may be more\nimportant to wine quality than the chemical profile. Eastern soils tend to be well balanced,\nalthough sometimes too fertile for the size of vine that makes the best wine. But if your goal is\nhigher production, a more fertile soil may be desirable. The physical properties of a soil can be\ndetermined most accurately using back hoe pits. Soil cores are helpful, but less revealing of a\nNutrient availability chart according to soil pH\n62\nsoil\u201fs physical properties. Both methods require an experienced soil scientist to interpret the\nresults accurately.\nBackhoe pits are the best way to examine the soil\u201fs physical features and may also offer\nclues to its chemical properties. Most vine roots occupy rip or plow depth (12-36\u201d) so it is\nimportant to sample at 12\u201d, 24\u201d and 36\u201d, and possibly to take an even deeper fourth sample. A\nwell-drained soil is often correlated with the rock content; more rock enhances drainage. Most\nfarmers dislike rocks in a field but wine growers often celebrate the presence of up to 50% rock\ncontent in vineyard soils. The shale soils of southeast Pennsylvania, for example, are excellent\nin terms of drainage. Backhoe pits allow a view of the entire soil profile (horizons) from the\nthickness of the topsoil to, in some cases, depth to bedrock. This is important, because it is the\nzone that the roots will inhabit. The analysis can also reveal other features that might affect vine\nperformance such as hard pans, fragipans, and high water tables. Hard pans indicate a need for\nsubsurface drain tile to assist water evacuation.\nBackhoe pits will reveal the texture and structure of the soil at various depths; the rooting\npattern of existing vegetation; and characteristics such as particular aromas, colors, textures, etc.\nthat offer clues to the experienced soil viticulturist or scientist regarding the overall quality of the\nsoil.

The\nsoil must be in a normal moisture condition\nat the time of the evaluation and there should\nbe no threat of rain on the day of the test.\nSafety is a concern when someone is in a soil\npit and the risk of a cave-in should be taken\nseriously.\nMost landowners will allow you to\ndig pits on their property for evaluation\npurposes. It may, however, be difficult\nand/or expensive to find a backhoe. Pits\nshould be dug where soil survey maps indicate that changes in the soil or obvious problems may\nexist. A good soil scientist will supplement maps with their own instinct of where soil changes\nmay occur. The number and location of the pits will vary depending on the site, but generally\none to two per acre should be sufficient. If a field is quite uniform fewer pits will be needed,\nwhereas fields with greater variability will require more sampling. Jan Waltz, an experienced\ngrower in Lancaster County, has underlined the importance of sampling across different contour\nsections and different cropping systems (such as corn, soybean and tobacco) in a field. A field\nViticulture soil scientist Alfred Cass at home in a soil pit in\nVirginia\n63\nthat was just used for corn may sample differently from the fallow section next to it. If obvious\nsoil differences or problems emerge, these areas should also be tested. Generally soil pits should\nbe dug on slopes at the bottom, mid-section and towards the top. The objective is to get a global\nview of the various soils in relation to the topography and other land features of your site.\nData from soil pits and cores should\nbe synthesized into a comprehensive soil\nmap. Are detailed soil maps strictly\nnecessary? No, but the best growers rely on\nthem to make critical decisions about\nrootstocks, varieties, irrigation, nutrition,\nvineyard design, trellis system, and vineyard\nfloor management. If vine and vineyard\nuniformity are necessary for high-quality\nwine production, then soil maps are the key\nto achieving this. They will explain\ndifferences in the soils and allow for correct\nviticulture assignments and management that\ncan build uniformity into a block of vines.\nThey constitute an up-front investment that\nwill pay long-term dividends in terms of the quality of the site. This information is crucial to an\nunderstanding of the soil component of the terroir of the site. It represents core knowledge of the\nsite that will serve as a reference resource for the life of the vineyard.\nRutger de Vink and soil scientist Alex Blackburn digging soil\ncores\n64\nSoil Evaluation and Soil Mapping for Vineyards\nAlex.

There is a considerable amount of very good information that has\nbeen written about soil science for vineyards in the arid West and we have been using this information as\npertinent here in the East.

Any digital site assessment system results must be supplemented by \u201cground truthing\u201d\nwork. It is not a substitute for a pits or cores, merely a general guide to suitable vineyard sites.\nSoil compaction can pose a serious problem for any farming operation. Compacted soils\ndeprive plants of air and water, hindering root development and nutrient uptake. A compacted\nsoil should be treated before the vines are planted and then afterwards as needed. Ripping the\nsoil is the usual prescribed treatment, but to which depth and in what direction(s) must be\ndetermined by evaluation. Compost and cover crops can also be used to reduce compaction.\nPenetrometer measurements can help to reveal the amount of soil compaction that occurs over a\nfield, especially if it has been farmed for a long period of time.\nSoil biology\nCompared to a soil\u201fs chemistry and physical properties, its biology is less well\nunderstood. We know that the soil is an incredibly rich ecosystem with vital interactions going\non between the plant, the soil and the atmosphere involving air, water and nutrient exchanges,\nand that microorganisms are busily engaged in processing and regulating many of these\nrelationships. However, much remains to be learned and we are not yet able to ameliorate the\nbiological properties of soil as confidently as we can adjust its chemical and physical properties.\nA grower will examine the soil primarily for harmful biological components such as pathogenic\nCornell\u2019s New York Vineyard Site Evaluation System\n67\nfungi and subterranean pests like nematodes and phylloxera.

Vidal Blanc, one of the most important\nwhite wine varieties in the East, is highly susceptible to ToRSV. Unfortunately, ToRSV also has\na wide range of host plants, including many native broadleaf weeds common to vineyards,\nmaking it difficult to control the source reservoir of the virus. Analysis for nematodes,\nparticularly in fields recently planted with grape or fruit crops, is an essential step in the preplant soil evaluation. If the numbers are above economic injury threshold levels, chemical or\nbiological remediation of the soil may be needed. It is strongly advised that old orchards and\nvineyards be left fallow for 1 to 3 years before being replanted to allow nematode populations to\nsubside. While they are not considered to be as serious a problem here as in California, their\npopulation and possible impact on vine health should be carefully monitored.\nA note on minerality and \u201csoil flavors\u201d\nThe wine world would be a dull and unromantic place without its wine writers waxing\npoetic about every manner of wine to whet our palates. However, when they cross over from the\ntasting room into the vineyard, hazards and misconceptions are often the result. One of the most\nfuriously debated topics in wine science is the origin of particular flavors identified with wines,\nsuch as the minerality often associated with Riesling from Germany or Chablis from France.\nWriters imply that there is a direct link between the slate soils of the steep slopes of the Mosel,\nthrough the vine and into the glass. In truth, there is at best an indirect affect of the nature of the\nsoil and the flavors that appear in the wines. Chemical elements are biosynthesized in the berry\ninto aromatic and flavor compounds that we associate with a particular terroir. But there is not,\nmuch to the chagrin of the romanticist, a direct connection between soil and wine flavors in the\nform of a compound that is extracted and processed into wine flavors. Exactly why clay, gravel\nand sand in the Medoc achieve such vastly different wines, or Syrah from the Rhone and Shiraz\nfrom Australia taste so utterly different, or Chardonnay can have so many guises around the\nworld is difficult to explain and one reason why people have been fascinated with wine for\nthousands of years. Someday, science may explain these phenomenon, or hopefully not.\nClimate and weather\nThere is an old saw that applies to grape growers, \u201cEveryone complains about the\nweather but no one ever does anything about it.\u201d When it comes to growing grapes the weather\nis paramount.

The weather sets the tone, strategy and work in the\nvineyard. Growers remember with fondness the great vintages because they were easy, fun,\nprofitable and produced excellent wines. They try (but fail) to forget the bad vintages and their\nHerculean struggles to get a good wine into the cellar. We cannot escape the fact that there is a\nstrong correlation between weather and wine quality. Wine growers love warm and dry harvest\nseasons. In Bordeaux warmer vintages that permitted a dry and early harvest have traditionally\nbeen the most highly praised. Arid regions are blessed with such conditions almost every year,\nbut wine districts in Europe and here in the East are not nearly so fortunate.\nAside from whatever the wine pundits say, the weather matters in both obvious and\nsubtle ways to vine culture and knowledge of the climate will help you to decide the best\nvarieties to plant, how to cope with rainfall, unfavorable temperatures, and the risk of winter\ninjury to vines, and how to make other important decisions based on the viticulture\ncharacteristics of the site. A distinction is necessary between climate and weather. In his wisdom\nMark Twain explained the difference thusly, \u201cClimate is what you expect. Weather is what you\nget\u201d (Mark Greenspan). Climate is the long-range weather pattern of a region. Weather is what\na grower ends up dealing with from one vintage to the next. Climate determines the varieties\nthat should be planted; the weather determines if the grapes will ripen properly in a given\nvintage.\nJuggling the elements\nClimate is therefore important to two of the most critical viticultural goals of any\nvineyard in the Eastern U.S.:\nRipening fruit to uniform and synchronous full maturity to make the best possible wine\nRipening wood to its maximum cold hardiness condition for winter survival\nIf the first goal is not achieved then there is little hope of making a good wine. If the\nsecond is missed there may not be a vine remaining to reach the first goal. In fact, from Virginia\nto Ontario the greatest single constraint to the cultivation of hybrid and vinifera grapes may be\nlow winter temperatures that can cause winter injury or death to vines. For direct evidence of the\ndangers that lurk at the bottom of the thermometer, ask any grower in the Finger Lakes or\nOntario about the damage caused by the freezing winters of 2003/4 and 2005/6. Everything\npossible must be done to understand and mitigate the threat and effects of winter injury, which\nwill upset uniformity in the vineyard and have a negative impact on wine quality.

The variable\nEastern climate will make the grower feel as\nif he or she is suffering from bipolar disorder.\nFor example, in a dramatic vintage shift the\nharvest in 2010 began almost three weeks\nearlier than in 2009. Ask the Eastern wine\ngrower to define an average harvest or\nharvest date and your likely to encounter a\nshrug. The reality for Eastern wine growers is\nthat they will worry about the weather almost\nevery day in every season, even the winter. Each\nmorning begins with the forecast and how it will impact the day\u201fs activities, vine health or fruit\nquality. As a vineyard site is evaluated, it is important to study the climate and weather that will\naffect grape culture. This begins with data collection that gradually develop into experience and\nknowledge of weather patterns that will provide you with a sixth sense about what the weather\nwill be in the future and how it will affect your vines, grapes and daily vineyard operations. This\nintuition will prove most valuable at harvest time, late in the season and often deep into autumn,\nwhen the weather is both more unpredictable and more important to wine quality than at any\nother time in the growing season. Whether the climate is coastal and cool, inland and hot,\ncontinental and warm, or wet and humid, long-term climate data lets growers know what to\nexpect. The uncertainty of the weather has been recently exacerbated by the unpredictable\neffects of climate change. The East appears to be experiencing extreme weather events such as\nhurricanes more frequently and temperatures are definitely warming. Try to find a site with a\nfavorable macro- and meso-climate that will allow good viticulture results in bad weather.\nWine growers must concern themselves with the climate on three levels:\no Macroclimate is climate on a large scale, the kind that we are referring to when we\ndiscuss climate change, or what is shown on the big map on the evening weather report.\nIt\u201fs the big picture, covering a large geographic area, and is measured over extended\nperiods of time, usually 30 years.\no Mesoclimate is the climate in and around the vineyard, which is affected by local effects\nsuch as topography. It is critical to ripening, frost and freeze damage, and even the\namounts of rainfall that you will experience in the vineyard.\no Microclimate is the environment in and around the individual vine. A large canopy will\nhave a different climate from a small canopy. The shade cast by large canopies is\ngenerally detrimental to good wine, because it increases humidity and reduces sunlight\nand air inside the canopy, causing fruit chemistry problems. Microclimate has a critical\neffect on the temperature around the fruit zone and how it affects the biological processes\nresponsible for fruit ripening. The biosynthesis of flavor and phenolic compounds is\nlargely driven by temperature, and therefore conditions in the fruit zone after veraison are\nvitally important to making fine wine.\nLow winter temperature thresholds per decade in\nPennsylvania (An-min Wu, 2006)\n70\nWine consumers have been told that the best wines come from places with warm days\nand cool nights, and to some extent this may be true.

Warm days help to ripen the fruit and cool\nnights help the berries to retain acidity. But in cooler climates where lower acidities are desired\nfor balance, warmer nights may be preferred. The subtle effects of temperature on vine\nphysiology can have a considerable impact on wine quality as they play a role in many of the\nbiological processes and the formation chemical constituents of wine. Many aspects of how\nvines function are not well understood or documented. For example, humidity is a major factor\nin Eastern viticulture yet little is known about how it affects grape quality. We are familiar with\nthe problems that humidity can cause in terms of fungal disease, but not how it influences the\nripening process.\nSunlight drives photosynthesis, and photosynthesis is responsible for the production of\nsugar, which creates the alcohol that is so important to balance and texture in wine. In overcast\nareas diffuse light, while quite efficient, does not have the same strength to push sugar\ndevelopment. Sunlight along with other meteorological conditions provide warmth (or the lack\nof it) to the soil and vines. So while light and temperature are closely related they impact\ndifferent physiological functions in the vine. A certain amount of warmth is critical to many\nimportant vine development (phenology) events. It is heat that warms the soil in spring,\nawakening the vines from winter dormancy. A fast and successful bloom period depends on\nwarm conditions in spring. During the critical post-veraison ripening period, warmth drives the\nfruit towards optimal maturity. Temperature influences the biochemical pathways responsible\nfor producing the secondary metabolites that are so critical to the flavor, color, and phenolic\ncompounds (tannins) needed to make good wine. Acidity in the grape juice is also affected by\ntemperature and in warm years the balance and freshness of a wine may be hampered by the\nrespiration of too much acid. Indeed, temperature conditions after veraison and right up to\nharvest day are absolutely crucial to wine quality and viticulture researchers urge growers in cool\nregions to keep the fruit warm. Site selection involves the careful match of the right varieties\nwith the most suitable climate conditions to achieve the goals of wine type and style.\nThere is a saying among wine growers that a warm site performs best in a cool region and\nconversely a cooler site will make the best wine in a warm region. While grape are cultivated\nacross a wide range of temperatures, they are most sensitive to cooler areas and lack character in\nhot areas. In California, which is a warm area except right on the coast, wine growers look for\nthe coolest mesoclimate that has adequate heat accumulation to consistently and fully mature a\ndesignated grape variety, and then narrow their search to a warm place in this cooler area. If the\nsite is too cool for the selected varieties, however, the fruit will not ripen properly and the\nhighest quality will not be achieved. Therefore, temperature extremes should be avoided.\nObserving the better wine regions around the world, it is easy to see that many of them are\nlocated away from areas that experience temperature extremes, where acid, flavor and aroma\ncompounds can \u201dburn off\u201d from too much heat.

Many fine wine regions have a coastal influence\nor, if located inland, enjoy the cooling effects of a higher elevation or latitude. Cool\ntemperatures allow for a slower, more regular accumulation of sugar and other compounds,\nespecially in the period up to harvest. There is no strict definition of a \u201ecool\u201f place, although\nregions like the Willamette Valley, Sonoma Coast, Finger Lakes and Ontario qualify as cool.\nVery hot regions such as the central valley of California are better suited for table and raisin\ngrapes or varieties for bulk and dessert wines.\nAs a general rule, in wine production the red varieties are more finicky when it comes to\nclimate than whites. Reds usually ripen later and are subject to the vagaries of autumn weather.\n71\nWhite grapes like Chardonnay and Riesling perform well over a somewhat wider range of\nclimatic (and other viticultural) conditions. Chardonnay can be found in both warm and cool\nclimates, where it will have different expressions. A Riesling harvest at 19 brix will taste\ndramatically different, although not necessarily better, than one picked at 23 brix. Syrah also\nadapts to a broad range of conditions, from Hermitage in the northern Rhone Valley to Shiraz in\nSouth Australia. Cabernet Sauvignon, a highly adaptable variety that is grown all over the\nworld, needs plenty of heat to get it ripe enough to make good wine. Pinot Noir also needs to be\ndead ripe to make a great wine and is less amenable to different conditions than Cabernet\nSauvignon.\nTemperature and the vines\nDuring the growing season, growers watch heat accumulation very carefully. They need\nthe right amount and distribution of heat to converge into a fine vintage. Too little heat\naccumulation will hamper fruit ripening. Too much heat compresses the growing season and\ndoes not allow for proper flavor development. In wine growing, the most critical temperature\nperiod occurs after veraision during the final push for full grape maturity. It\u201fs also is important\nto a successful bloom (pollination) and bud initiation for the following season around the period\nof fruit set. That\u201fs why during certain times of year growers tend to be more nervous than at\nothers. Of course, frost and winter injury can cause serious temperature related problems for\ngrapevines. 2003 and 2009 were very cool and wet years in the Mid-Atlantic region and the\nquality of wines reflect these conditions. In warm seasons like 2007 and 2010, wine makers\nrejoice. It\u201fs never easy however. In warm years aromatic whites varieties may lose acidity and\naromatic intensity even as red varieties excel. It is always a matter of seeking balance between\nthe variety and the seasonal conditions that tests the grower and wine maker.\nGrowing degree days\nGDD or heat summation is a system that is used to measure heat accumulation over a\nperiod of time. For grapes in the East this period generally extends from April 1 to October 31\nand uses 50\u00ba Fahrenheit as the baseline (marking the temperature threshold between activity and\ndormancy for a vine), GDD provides a guideline for matching varieties to the mesoclimate of an\narea.

Hot climate varieties for dessert\nwines and table and raisin grapes can be\ngrown in regions with more than 4000 GDD. Growing degree days for Pennsylvania (An-min Wu, 2006)\n72\nGrowing degree days is a useful guide, although it only records the difference between\nthe maximum daily temperature and the baseline of 50\u00baF and therefore does not take into account\nvariations in diurnal temperatures (in particular nighttime temperatures above 50o\nF), humidity,\nwind, light intensity and other key environmental factors. Despite its flaws, it has become the\nstandard yardstick to compare temperature profiles between wine regions around the world. The\nheat summation of a site will help as a general guide to variety assignment. There are climate\ndata services that use software to process land-based climate data and that can interpolate\nhistorical and current climate conditions to almost any remote site.\nFrost\nFrost is a great concern in almost all Eastern wine regions and in recent years climate\nchange appears to be making late spring frost a greater hazard. Spring frost can damage or kill\ntender young shoots, while an early fall frost can knock leaves off a vine before the fruit is fully\nmature. Although it usually does not kill vines, it certainly can hamper a vintage, upset\nuniformity, complicate canopy management, reduce the crop, and exacerbate winter injury\nproblems. Frost avoidance begins with selecting the correct varieties and designing a vineyard\nthat will mitigate the threat. It is important to know the number of frost-free days for any new\nvineyard site and the required length of growing season for the varieties being considered.\nCabernet Sauvignon typically requires a minimum of 185 days from bud break to harvest in\norder to ripen its grape to full maturity and needs its full complement of leaves for each one of\nthose days. If the growing season is cut short the fruit will not ripen and wine quality will suffer.\nThere are both passive and active measures to confront frost and now is the time to\nincorporate as many passive measures as possible into the vineyard, including proper site and\nvariety selection. Site selection is by far the best frost-avoidance strategy. Cold air settles\nclosest to the ground and should be moved quickly away from vines. Avoid concave land\nfeatures since cold air (and water) will pool in the bowl. Air flows a lot like water so features\nthat encourage surface drainage will help relocate cold air. Slopes and vineyard borders free of\nimpediments (hills, trees, buildings, etc) will promote good air drainage. Vineyards planted on\nthe top or at mid-slope on a hill will usually fair better than those below. But higher elevation\nwill mean cooler summer temperatures, which could delay ripening. Choose varieties carefully\nbecause late reds will never mature if the leaves get frosted every fall, or if early budding\nChardonnay gets burned back by frost every spring yields and quality will suffer.\nActive protection", "doc_id": "4c53db11-38d7-4c3b-97ef-78d4723a35e7", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "dedb2a79d0276c6f31434e6804c523017ef696241a41e721549895f5aeb1a772", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 313630, "end": 317658}, "relationships": {"1": "acd3b8f9-6274-4b01-8706-eb3b89775b72", "2": "4323d371-7a28-4658-ba43-eb14fdb8aff7", "3": "c126067b-197c-40f3-afe3-ce33be548d59"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "c126067b-197c-40f3-afe3-ce33be548d59": {"__data__": {"text": "to the ground and should be moved quickly away from vines.

In California, the most frost-prone areas rely on\noverhead irrigation to protect new and tender shoot tissue from frost. Microjet misters and\noverhead sprinklers are used to coat the vines with a layer of ice; the freezing process releases\nheat, which warms the air and can protect green tissue to about 22o\nF. Note that this system\nrequires a vast amount of water to be available on demand. During radiation frost conditions\n(cold air but little or no wind, which is typical of regions such as Ontario) wind fans, which mix\nwarmer, rising air with the colder air near the ground, are used extensively for both frost and\nfreeze protection. There are tower and low-profile machines that can cover 7-12 acres, but they\nneed to be placed in strategic positions in order to maximize their effect. Using helicopters to\nmix warmer air with cold air near the ground is another measure that can be used against frost.\n73\nWinter injury\nThe same general conditions that increase the risk of frost damage will also exacerbate\nwinter injury. Cold air moves and settles in much the same way as water. Low areas are always\nat greatest risk of frost and winter injury. These areas are typically wetter and more fertile,\nresulting in a bigger vine that acclimates later and more slowly than those on lighter soils. In\nsaturated soils the vines may also be stressed. These conditions result in vines that are more\nvulnerable to winter injury. Do not plant vines in wet, low-lying areas in a field.\nDifferent grape varieties have varying tolerances to low temperatures (ranging from\nextremely cold-hardy native species and newer hybrids (such as those introduced by the\nUniversity of Minnesota) to cold-sensitive classic European vinifera, with many of the\ninterspecific hybrid varieties lying somewhere in-between. The low temperature thresholds of\ngrape varieties should be compared to the historic climate data of the site to assess the cold\ninjury risk. This threshold is a moving target and will depend on the quality of tissue acclimation\nin the vines in any given year and the weather conditions during the winter. A false spring in\nJanuary or February may slightly de-acclimate the vines, making them sensitive to a sudden drop\nin temperature. A rapid drop in temperature before the vines are fully cold-acclimated can also\ncause injury. Common viticulture lore supposes that the south side of vines, or vines on a\nwarmer south slope, may be at higher risk for winter injury due to the greater warming effect of\nthe sun on the vine, a least compared to the shaded side of the vine or vineyard.\nWinter injury should be considered a serious threat to the economic viability and longterm sustainability of a vineyard.

In the red\nvarieties it may lead to excessive methoxypyrazine production, which causes unwanted bell\npepper and asparagus flavors. All of these are detrimental to wine quality. Supplying the vine\nwith just enough water \u2013 through rainfall and, when that fails, irrigation \u2013 at just the right times\nto keep the vine active but not overly vigorous is ideal but not easy. Soils in Bordeaux \u2013 from\nthe gravel in the Medoc to the clay in Pomerol \u2013 strike the correct balance and yet even there the\ncooler clays perform better in hot years and the warmer gravel will yield elegant wines in cooler\nvintages. This is why so much attention must be paid to soil drainage and nutrient properties,\nand an irrigation system may be necessary. Grape growers are continually trying to ameliorate\nthe conditions that Mother Nature provides in any given year.\nMany wine regions in the East average about 40\u201d of rainfall annually, which is well\nwithin the limits of most fine wine districts around the world. The Sonoma and Willamette\nvalleys receive about this amount of rain. The problem lies in the distribution rather than the\ntotal amount of rainfall. Too much or too little water at a crucial time is deleterious to wine\nquality. Excess vine vigor resulting from rain before, but even more crucially after veraison can\ndamage fruit quality by causing increased disease and berry size and impeding fruit ripening. In\nthe East there is usually an overabundance of water, particularly around or after veraison when\n74\nstopping shoot tip growth and getting the vine to focus on fruit ripening is absolutely critical to\nsuccess.\nIn his book The Finest Wines of Bordeaux (2010), author James Lawther illustrates the\nimportance of timing of water and vine growth from research done at the University of\nBordeaux:\nThe report notes that for the \u201cperfect red vintage\u201d five successive factors are necessary\nin the growth cycle of the vine: an early and rapid flowering (for even maturity and\nyield); a little water stress at berry set (to limit berry size); the cessation of vine growth\nbefore veraison (achieved by mild water stress); an adequate leaf canopy (with enough\nwater available so leaves are active) to ensure complete ripeness of the berries; and\nclement conditions during the harvest to bring maturity to the later-ripening parcels and\nvarieties.\nKees van Leeuwen, who assisted with this research and is also the viticulture consultant to\nChateau Cheval Blanc in St Emilion, states emphatically that water and nitrogen are two of the\nmost important factors in determining fruit quality and must be available in proper amounts at\nthe correct moment to ensure the highest quality grapes.\nSo it is not a surprise that the best wine growers spend a lot of time and effort figuring\nout how to influence water/vine relations and control vine vigor. In regions like Europe and the\nEastern U.S. this is a real challenge (arid regions can rely on regulated deficit irrigation).\nBesides soil drainage, other viticulture tools such as cover crops can be employed to", "doc_id": "bda30374-60ea-4860-90d6-9fc213a7f76a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b1a8525039393265d7f2f3c560d70ab25e4bffc722286ccc87bd7d0a12a6b223", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 321680, "end": 325674}, "relationships": {"1": "acd3b8f9-6274-4b01-8706-eb3b89775b72", "2": "c126067b-197c-40f3-afe3-ce33be548d59", "3": "4154ab5a-485c-4117-85c5-41d98b6e189f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4154ab5a-485c-4117-85c5-41d98b6e189f": {"__data__": {"text": "bring maturity to the later-ripening parcels and\nvarieties.\nKees van Leeuwen, who assisted with this research and is also the viticulture consultant to\nChateau Cheval Blanc in St Emilion, states emphatically that water and nitrogen are two of the\nmost important factors in determining fruit quality and must be available in proper amounts at\nthe correct moment to ensure the highest quality grapes.\nSo it is not a surprise that the best wine growers spend a lot of time and effort figuring\nout how to influence water/vine relations and control vine vigor. In regions like Europe and the\nEastern U.S. this is a real challenge (arid regions can rely on regulated deficit irrigation).\nBesides soil drainage, other viticulture tools such as cover crops can be employed to reduce vine\nvigor in a wet year.\nRain shadows\nWhy do some vineyards seem to consistently receive more or less rain than others located\nrelatively close by? The phenomenon of \u201crain shadows\u201d or areas that, due to the interaction of\nparticular land and climate features, receive less rain than surrounding areas could benefit wine\ngrowers in wet areas. It could also help to shield them from the hail events that are so\ndevastating to vines and crops. While the pattern of summer thunderstorms appears to be\nrandom, there are some areas that typically receive less rain than others and here topographic\nfeatures may exert an influence. It is well known, for example, that mountains can create this\neffect. A good example is the difference in precipitation between the Willamette Valley on the\nwest side of the Cascade Mountains in Oregon and the high desert to the east. In the East rain\nshadows are probably much more subtle and have not been given much attention. If rain\nshadows can be located and mapped, vineyard site selection would be greatly improved. These\nconditions could be identified by talking to experienced growers, collecting your own climate\ndata or using a climate data service to analyze the amounts and distribution of rainfall in a\nregion. Climate mapping deserves to be used much more widely than it is now as a standard tool\nin viticulture, particularly in site selection.\nToo much rain may lead to excessive compaction if the soil is not in optimum condition\nand you are constantly traveling over the vineyard rows with heavy equipment, such as sprayers\nto protect against insects and disease. Heavy, compacted soils do not drain well and limit root\ngrowth and overall vine health.\nWet and cool (they usually go together) produce the most resource-intensive vintages. A\ngrower will spend much more in a wet year on fungicides and, possibly, herbicides. Because of\n75\nincreased vine vigor, more canopy management will be necessary such as leaf removal and\nhedging. The grape quality will probably be lower and grape prices may reflect this. The\nharvest will be slower and more laborious, increasing labor costs. A dry vintage is certainly\npreferable for wine quality and the bottom line.\nUnderstanding the vineyard climate\nClimate and weather are important to viticulture and every effort should be made to\nunderstand how they will affect the health of the vine and the quality of the fruit in your\nvineyard. Begin by gathering any historic climate data that can be found about the site or the\nimmediate area. A neighboring farmer or weather enthusiast, a small private airport or even an\nNOAA weather station can provide a wealth of information. Orchard growers are especially\nsensitive to weather conditions and patterns that affect grapes and can often share valuable\ninsights into the local climate. USDA Temperature Zone charts drawn up region by region\nprovide a good general guide to low winter temperatures and the length of the growing season.\nMinnesota cold hardy hybrids can survive in Zone 3, but most vinifera will prefer the warmer\nside of Zone 6 to Zone 7.

Hybrid grapes can survive in Zone 5.\nWhile you should not base any decisions regarding varietal suitability on the (still\nhypothetical) effects of climate change on your site, you should be aware that the boundaries of\nthe USDA temperature zones are shifting north. Researchers at Cornell report that winter\ntemperatures in the northeast have averaged 4\u00baF warmer over the past decade, presumably due to\nclimate change. Be sure to consult maps that have been updated for climate change.\nAmong the first things a prudent grower should do once he or she has decided to develop\na site into a vineyard is to place weather stations or data loggers around their property. In just\nthe one to two years prior to planting, much valuable local climate data can be collected and used\nin the vineyard design process. If this information can be supplemented with 10, 20 or 30 years\nof historical climate data then very informed decisions about variety selection and placement can\nbe made. The data will also help to illuminate danger zones for frost and winter injury.\nEventually the data can be used in disease and pest modeling systems to predict outbreaks or the\nkey phenological stages of these organisms, so that you can combat them more effectively with\nfewer and less noxious measures.\nData loggers can help you to develop a climatological profile for the mesoclimate in and\naround the vineyard or even\nthe microclimate of the vines.\nPrior to planting heat\nsummation, spring and fall\nfrost dates, and low winter\ntemperatures data are of\ninterest. Collecting this data\nover time will help to define\nthe overall climate patterns\naround the vineyard.\nConditions such as max/min temperatures (diurnal temperature\nshift), relative humidity, rainfall amounts and distribution, wind\ndirection and velocity, photosynthetically active light (PAR)\nconditions, and leaf wetness are all key climate indices.\nTwo types of data loggers: Davis on\nleft and Spectrum Hobo on right\n76\nData loggers run from very simple, inexpensive (smoke alarm size) devices that monitor\nlittle more than temperature (max./min.) to professional grade instruments that use radio\ntelemetry to send the data directly to the computer in your office. There are many companies\nthat make high-quality data logger systems. One reasonably priced and reliable weather station\nsystem is the Watchdog 2900ET from Spectrum. It records the temperature, humidity, solar\nradiation, rainfall, wind direction, and wind speed. Onset HOBO units are small temperature data\nloggers that are great for checking temperatures around the vineyard site, typically at the top,\nmiddle and bottom of a slope. This is how to begin building a climate record for a vineyard site.\nGrowers talk about the weather constantly during the growing season. How low did the\ntemperature dip in February?

Hard winter freeze episodes and significant storm events after veraison are close to\ndeal breakers for fine wine production. Analyze the risk of these events and proceed\naccordingly.\nPost-veraison weather, as the grapes enter the stretch run for maturity, is probably the\nmost critical and worrisome time for growers. An extended period of weather is necessary to get\nlate reds like Cabernet Sauvignon and Chambourcin to full maturity. If it\u201fs too warm varieties\nlike Merlot and Pinot Noir that have short harvest windows of optimal flavors may get overripe.\nIf it\u201fs cool and wet, even the more versatile white varieties may not develop the characteristic\nflavors that define the variety. Bad harvest weather creates complications with diseases such as\nbotrytis bunch rot, sour, bitter and ripe rots. And the longer the grapes are left to hang on the\nvines, the more predation from birds, deer, yellow jackets and others will diminish yields and\nquality. Grape growers should develop multiple sources of reliable weather forecasting to help\nplan their spray applications and harvest activities. Fortunately, with the Internet, any person can\naccess the same information available to the television weather people. It\u201fs much easier and\nmore reliable now to track the weather. Of course, it\u201fs still impossible to change it!\nThe best growers develop an intuition about the weather and use it, together with\nforecasting information, to guide their viticulture practices during the growing season. They do\nnot merely respond to weather events; they anticipate them and make critical adjustments as the\nseason develops. For example, a cool, wet spring portends a later harvest, which means that rain\nmay become an issue with the risk of more botrytis and other bunch rots. This may require the\napplication of four botrytis sprays instead of two and additional canopy management.\nExperienced growers have a sense of how the weather is affecting grape quality during the\nharvest season. The rain pattern may give you the impression that the progression of grape\nripening is taking one step backward for every two steps forward, but when it reaches the point\nof one forward and two back, then it\u201fs time to pick. The decision regarding when there is more\nto gain than to lose by leaving the fruit on the vine is highly intuitive and depends mostly on the\nweather.\nAfter years of experience growing grapes the recollection of past seasons will be colored\nby memories of the weather and how it affected the resulting wines. The high point could be a\n77\nsingle event (a hurricane or tropical storm) or simply the impression of a gloriously dry and\nsunny harvest season. The weather defines much of growing wine.\nOther important site considerations\nMatching varieties to the subtle influence of mesoclimate and site characteristics is\nessential to achieving consistently high quality grape results.

Vineyard layout and topographic features are\nclosely integrated and should be designed to achieve the maximum viticultural advantage.\nWhich grape varieties will perform the best depends on the characteristics of the site you\nselect. In the East, Cabernet Sauvignon/warm, Riesling/cool, Merlot/moderate are just some of\nthe possibilities. The effects of slope, elevation and aspect are subtle, but can have a great\nimpact. For example, there is a vineyard in the Finger Lakes that is laid out in long rows on a\nflat plain had with an almost imperceptible dip in the middle. In the winter of 2005, vines\nlocated in that slight dip were killed. There are various possible explanations for this vine\nmortality: the dip may have slightly deeper soils with poor drainage; higher soil moisture in the\nfall could have delayed vine acclimation; or in the winter, cold air could have pooled in the\ndepression and killed the vines. In California such a dip would not have been an issue, but in the\nEast it doesn\u201ft take much of a change in the physical features of a site to affect vine health and\nsurvival. This demonstrates that site selection, preparation and design can be a matter of life and\ndeath for the vine and make or break for the vineyard.\nSlope, aspect and elevation\nEither a slope or the top of a hill are desirable locations for planting a vineyard. The\nbenefits of convex surfaces cannot be stressed enough. A slope promotes water and air drainage,\nalthough steeper slopes are prone to soil erosion, and safe equipment operation, especially on\nside slope, becomes a concern. Some of the best wine growers in the region stress the need for\nslope, even up to 20% in a wet growing region, as necessary to mitigate excess soil moisture.\nBut even a gentle slope of a few percent can improve drainage conditions. In small vine\nviticulture, sloped and well-drained sites can make a significant difference to vine size and\nperformance. Almost all vineyard operations get more complicated as slope increases, especially\nif the surface is wet. With slope comes aspect and the two features must work together for the\ngreatest benefit to the vine. In most of the East, southeast to southwest slopes are most effective\nand north-south (or tilted slightly to northeast) row orientation is preferable. Northwest to\nnortheast slopes, with the exception of warm areas or short season varieties, should generally be\navoided. Flat fields or gentle slopes benefit mostly from correct row orientation and elevation.\nSlope and aspect can combine to give a vineyard an advantage when it comes to capturing light\nand heat, a particular advantage to ripening fruit in the cooler, later days of the harvest season.\nWhen considering the effects of elevation on the vineyard, one must distinguish between\nthe local and the absolute elevation. A \u201csweet spot\u201d in absolute and local elevation is a vineyard\nin a prime ripening zone that runs a lower risk of frost and winter injury.

Local elevations\ninclude topographic variations that can have a direct affect on the vines and comprises\n78\ntopographical features such as hills, valleys, and plains that define the area around the vineyard.\nThe absolute elevation is the height above sea level of the vineyard, which will influence the\ntemperature range across seasons. The position of the vines on a hill will affect their\nsusceptibility to frost and winter injury. The temperature will decrease at a rate of 3.5\u00ba F with\nevery 1000-foot increase in elevation. The absolute elevation will affect the physiology of the\nvine and fruit ripening in the summer, and the temperatures to which the vines will be exposed in\nthe winter.\nTalking with local growers could reveal the location of potential sweet spots. In the\nWillamette Valley of Oregon there is a prime zone located between 400-700 feet, while some of\nCalifornia\u201fs greatest wines are grown in the Santa Cruz Mountains above 2000 feet. In\nColorado, vines grow at a mile-high elevation in desert conditions. Among the rolling hills the\nnorthern Piedmont Plain in southeast Pennsylvania, vineyards perform well at 300\u2013600 feet of\nelevation. In warmer states such as Virginia and North Carolina, the foothills of the Blue Ridge\nMountains at about 1000 feet is considered to offer a nice balance between the heat of the valley\nfloor and the cool conditions near the mountain peaks.\nThe local climate will be conditioned by topographical features that influence air\ndrainage, especially in the case of cold air that may cause spring and fall frosts or winter freezes.\nOther phenomena such as fog intrusion will be affected by the local topography and elevation; at\nnight the settling of cold air may push warm air higher into the hills. It\u201fs often said that the best\nposition on the hill is the mid-section, the top being too exposed with shallow soils and the\nbottom too fertile with the added risk of frost. In many great wine-growing areas the best wines\ncome from the mid-slope, but in the East the tops of moderate slopes may offer the best\ncombination of physiographic effects, with lighter soils, moderate temperatures, and a breeze\nover the top of the hill.\n79\nTrees\nSelecting a Site: The Scariest and Most Important Decision\nEd Boyce, Owner and Vintner\nBlack Ankle Vineyard, Mt. Airy, Maryland\nMy wife Sarah and I first got the idea to become winegrowers in 1998, when we were contemplating big\ncareer changes. Our goal was to grow world-class wine in the Mid-Atlantic. Given the immature state of the local\nwine industry, we quickly decided that site selection would take much more work than in more mature winegrowing\nareas (e.g. California\u201fs North Coast, Bordeaux, or Burgundy) where the key attributes needed for a great vineyard are\ngenerally known and agreed upon.\nWe asked several local growers what made a good site, but since most had not actively chosen a site,\nplanting on ground they already owned, we felt we needed more insight. We eventually traveled to many of the\nworld\u201fs great wine regions (Rhone Valley, Chablis, Bordeaux, California, Piedmont, New Zealand, etc.) and asked\nquestion after question about growing world class wine.

As a result, we ranked our selection criteria in the following order: well\ndrained soil, low vigor soil, aspect (not too much north-facing land), relative elevation (if a local but biblical flood\ncame, would your site be the first under water or the last?), absolute elevation, and farmability (slopes not too steep\nfor equipment, stretches to plant long rows, etc.). We settled on a goal of 30-50 plantable acres, and in our area that\nmeant we needed a farm of 100 or more acres (the non-plantable acres being too wet, too low, or too vigorous for\nhigh quality grapes).\nWe began by searching the internet for farms/land for sale. We took an altimeter to measure exact altitude,\nNRCS soil maps to get elevations, aspects and quick soil descriptions, and we started shopping for land. We quickly\nrealized we needed the help of a good local real estate agent, and after a few fits and starts we found one. She pointed\nus to several properties that were not officially on the market, but whose owners might consider selling. We also\nlooked at old listings that hadn\u201ft sold, in case the owners were still interested in selling. Finally, we drove all the\ncounty roads we could find looking for potential sites, wrote down the addresses, and our real estate agent cold called\nthem. In this way we ended up looking at over 50 different pieces of land before we bought what has become Black\nAnkle Vineyards.\nHow did we choose among all of the properties we toured? We hired a well-known viticulturalist to help us\nevaluate sites, and talked with several soil scientists as well. We dug 15-foot deep soil pits to look at the soil profile\nbelow the surface. All the same, in the end local knowledge, intuition and winegrowing folk wisdom were the\ndeciding factors.

Hillsides usually have good air and water drainage,\nand millenniums of erosion often take the most fertile soil down to the valleys \u2013 so we definitely got excited at hilly\nsites. Many of the best vineyards in Europe have extremely rocky soil, and although we never really got a definitive\nanswer as to why that is good for wine quality (explanations we heard ranged from drainage to heat retention to weed\ncontrol to mineral aromas/flavors), we decided at that, at the very least, 30% stone means only 70% soil, which would\nhelp to hold down vigor.\nLooking for a premium site is a lot of hard work and it isn\u201ft a quick process (it took us 10 months of almost\nfull-time searching to find our property), but that hard work pays off for many, many years. The patience, research,\nand tenacity we put into our site selection process were the best investments we have made in our business.\n80\nTrees are generally no friends to viticulture. Setting aside their beauty and any historic\nvalue they may possess, they usually bring more problems than benefits to wine quality.\nWooded areas around the perimeter provide roosts for hungry birds during harvest. Trees\naccommodate for wild, native vine species, which serve as host plants and vectors for diseases\n(such as the grapevine yellows) and insects (such as the grape berry moth). Problems with deer,\nturkeys, raccoons, bears and other grape-eating critters, are likely\nto be worse if there are woods nearby. Trees hinder the welcome\nbreezes that are needed to dry out vines wet with morning dew or\nrain, resulting in a higher incidence of disease. Trees also\nblock out sunlight, especially late in the season when the sun is\nalready low on the horizon and every minute of sunlight counts.\nTrees roots will compete with vines for moisture and nutrients and\ncan stunt the growth of vines many rows deep into a vineyard and\nsome species such as black walnut exude a toxic chemical that\nhinder vine growth. Root pruning can be helpful in managing wooded borders, but this requires\na deep ripper, a big tractor, and time. An ample buffer of 100\u201f or more between the vineyard\u201fs\nedge and any woods is recommended. All wild vines should be cut at the ground 20\u201f or more\ninto the woods. If possible, save the valuable and attractive trees and remove the scrap. In all\ncases, airflow will be enhanced if shrubs and brush is removed from the floor of the woods.\nRocks\nRocks below the surface can be big plus for a vineyard site. Rocks on or near the surface\ncan be a pain. In some vineyards picking up rocks is a never-ending chore, but it must be done\nbecause rocks of all sizes can cause problem for trellis installation and equipment operation and\nlongevity.

Rocks can be used in\ndrainage features and make an attractive wall around vineyards.\nPollution\nVarious forms of pollution can wreak havoc on vineyards. When evaluating a site, it is\nhelpful to know what sort of activities are going on in the neighborhood. For example, brick and\nconcrete factories emit by-products that can affect the health and quality of a vineyard. Pesticide\ndrift or run-off from neighboring farms and housing developments, especially the volatile\nherbicide 2,4-D, can cause deformed leaves on sensitive vines. Problems with pollution are not\nlimited to human activities in the immediate area of the vineyard. Ozone can compromise the\nhealth of a sensitive variety like Chambourcin. A nearby abandoned vineyard can be a source of\npollution in the form of diseases and insect pests that build up over time and migrate to a\nneighbor\u201fs vineyard.\nBiological threats\nThe list of biological threats to vine cultivation is long and daunting and if the cost of\ndeveloping a vineyard doesn\u201ft scare off the would-be wine grower then the challenges of\nmanaging these many possible maladies should. They range from the invisible (underground or\nmicroscopic) to the very large (deer, elk, bear). Vines are very resilient plants and can tolerate a\n81\nlot of stress and strain, but alone or in combination these threats to vine health can lower\nproductivity or outright kill a vine. Among the biotic threats are Pierce\u201fs disease and grapevine\nyellows, two maladies that are transported by insects and can kill vines. Like winter injury, PD\nis such a pervasive threat that measures throughout the vineyard system must be taken to deal\nwith it. Fungi and bacteria like botrytis and crown gall are ubiquitous in the air and soil so they\nmust be carefully managed to have minimal impact on vine culture. Insects feed on leaves,\nshoots and fruit and can transmit pathogens like leafroll virus from host to vine or vine to vine\nand yellow jackets and wasps Subterranean threats like phylloxera and grape root borer are out\nof sight but should not be out of mind. Critters from rabbits to raccoons will threaten your crop.\nAt some point you\u201fll have to deal with many or all of these threats but it\u201fs best to be aware of\nthem and avoid them if possible.\nMan-made factors\nThere are various non-viticultural factors that can influence the value and suitability of a\nsite for vineyards. As more vineyards are being built, they are beginning to butt up against\nsubdivisions, resulting in problems at the agriculture/urban interface. In genteel but crowded\nrural areas, the NIMBY (not in my backyard) attitude tends to prevail. This is an issue that you\nignore at your peril. As much as you love vineyards and think they are beautiful and serene, do\nnot assume that everyone will be thrilled by the prospect of having a vineyard in the\nneighborhood.

The best strategy is to assuage their fears by engaging in a\nconcerted education campaign, although you should also prepare yourself by getting to know\nexactly what your rights are according to the zoning of the property. Talk to your vineyard\nassociation and to other grape growers located in similar areas about their experiences. If your\nvineyard lies near a residential area, be extremely conscious of spray drift plumes, bird-scaring\ndevices, and other practices that \u2013 while perfectly legal \u2013 could raise the ire of neighbors. And\nrealize that no matter how diplomatic you are, there will probably be at least one neighbor who\nopposes what you are doing and who may try to take legal measures. Shared resources such as\nwater can be impacted by the activities of your neighbors. It would be wise to assess the\npresence off-farm threats and the costs that might be involved in any losses or attempts to\nmitigate their effects. The California Wine Growers Association publishes an excellent bulletin\non vineyard/neighbor relations (see information resources list).\nYou should be thoroughly informed regarding all land use regulations and zoning laws\npertaining to your property. These are the legal foundations on which your vineyard must be\nbuilt. The zoning should have an agricultural component in it. Pennsylvania township planning\nboards can exert considerable influence over local businesses. Environmental impact studies,\nwhile expensive, complicated and time-consuming, may be necessary, especially if you are\nlocated near a protected area, and if you neglect this requirement you could regret it later. In\nPennsylvania some vineyards and wineries have had problems with local township planning\nboards. As with the neighbors, a little pro-active education can go a long way in answering the\nconcerns of poorly informed or uninformed government officials. If problems persist, programs\nsuch as ACRE in Pennsylvania (administered by the Department of Agriculture) have been set\nup to protect farmers against frivolous obstructionism and harassment by citizens and local\nofficials who may be attempting to block perfectly normal agricultural practices.\nInfrastructure\n82\nAnother vital consideration will be your sources of water, necessary for irrigation,\nspraying, and even frost protection. Can a spring be tapped and stored in cisterns or a pond? Is a\nwell available and what is the quality and quantity of water available? Infrastructure\nrequirements such as electricity, property access, work areas, and so on are important as well.\nDo not rush the site selection process. Vineyards are legacy projects and decisions made\nup front will have consequences that last for a lifetime or more. Ultimately your vineyard must\nbe a source of pride and joy and these emotions will be correlated to its success and the wines it\nproduces. It truly pays to get everything right from the start.

These vines have to go the distance, hopefully 20 years or\nmore of productive life and income for the grower, so there is this one initial opportunity to\nchoose the right varieties for the site and market and obtain healthy plants. Deciding what to\ngrow is a complicated process. Nowadays there are so many components to a grapevine: variety,\nclone, rootstock, certified or non-certified, bench-grafted, own-rooted, one or two year old,\ndormant or green, bare root or potted, grade quality, etc. Therefore a lot of time and worry will\nbe expended prior to placing a vine order, as you decide exactly how to mix and match these\nvine components and what kind of plants will be needed to meet wine type and style objectives.\nA delicate balance of viticulture and marketing decisions must be made and the permanence of\nthe results increases the pressure to get it right from the start. It\u201fs best to consider all of your\noptions very carefully and then be decisive and confident in the choices made. Choosing your\nvarieties and then ordering your plants will give the project a sense of reality that a vineyard will\nsoon appear.\nEvery grower interviewed for this manual stressed the importance of starting a vineyard\nproject with healthy vine materials. Securing high-quality plant material requires considerable\nplanning and effort, however. The timing \u2013 from order placement to delivery \u2013 will influence all\nother phases of the development project, especially if grafted vines are being used. If uncommon\nvarieties, clones and/or rootstocks are selected, this can slow the entire process depending on\navailability. Therefore it is important to get this phase underway as quickly, but also as\naccurately as possible. In a down cycle market, such as during the recession that began in 2008,\nplanting slows dramatically. California drives the vinifera nursery industry and plant availability\nis strongly influenced by planting activity there. Eastern nurseries can supply hybrid and native\nvarieties. In a boom period, such as was experienced during the 1990\u201fs, almost all plant\nmaterials can be hard to find.\nFor most people the whole idea of having a vineyard revolves around what varieties to\ngrow. It is an important decision with lasting consequences. No new grower wants to regret a\nchoice five or ten years from now. There\u201fs no point in making a widget if there is no market for\nit and this principle applies to grapes and wine. This is always a source of anxiety when\ndeciding exactly what to plant. There are three variables to consider: a) what you like to drink,\nb) what grapes/wine are selling best at this time (i.e., what the wineries want), and c) the grape\nthat will perform the best viticulturally on a chosen site. In an ideal world, all three merge into\none variety but there is usually some tension between them. The viticultural requirements are\nprobably the most important, because it allows the best quality fruit to be produced, which will\nincrease the likelihood of a buyer. Prospective growers must study the market closely by talking\nto local wineries and vineyards and finding out not only what is popular today, but what will be\nin demand tomorrow. If variety choice is being guided mainly by personal wine preferences,\nthen the project is more likely a hobby and not intended as a commercial business.\nViticulture considerations\nThe important first step is to pick the varieties, clones and rootstocks that will perform\nbest on your site.

Such a list can be compiled by a viticulture advisor based on the soil and\nclimate data from the site evaluation results.\n84\nRegarding climate, the vines must survive the winter and produce fully mature grapes on\na consistent basis. Adequate cold hardiness is the most important factor in colder regions,\nfollowed by many other variables that impact quality and survivability. If winter injury is a\npotential problem, then the choice of varieties will be limited primarily to native and hybrid\nvarieties. This can be a harsh reality for many people who enjoy drinking wines made from\nclassic European varieties, but have a vineyard site that excludes these for one reason or another.\nSome forge ahead stubbornly only to suffer losses from winter injury or other problems.\nNonetheless, it is possible that a balance of cold hardy and cold tender varieties can be arrived at\nthat will satisfy both viticultural and marketing needs. Then, if a winter injury event occurs the\ncold hardy varieties will continue to generate revenues until the damaged vines can return to\nproduction.\nWhite wine grapes, especially among the hybrids\nand vinifera, are less finicky than reds, capable of higher\nyields, and will ripen in a wider range than reds. For\nexample, Riesling can make a delicious wine at 19 brix or\n23 brix. On either side of this ripeness spectrum there will\nbe an acceptable wine style. But if Cabernet Franc only\nachieves 19 brix, it will produce a veggie wine that no one\nwill like. In general, white varieties are less viticulturally\ndemanding than red varieties. Ripening parameters such as\navailable growing degree days, frost-free periods, and\ndiurnal temperature variations (especially after veraison)\nwill all contribute to the identification of the correct\nvariety. Dr. Greg Jones, a climatologist at Southern\nOregon University, offers a general illustration of the\ntemperature ripening ranges of major vinifera varieties.\nHeat summation charts and USDA plant hardiness zones\nare other tools to help assign variety to site.\nThere are reasons why Riesling thrives in Germany,\nCabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in Bordeaux and Napa,\nNebbiolo in Piemonte, and Sangiovese in Tuscany, but even within these regions there are slight\nbut specific differences in ripening characteristics. It is important to match the variety with the\nsite\u201fs ability to fully ripen the fruit on a consistent basis. Look to climate data (particularly\naverage length of growing season and growing degree days), neighbors\u201f vineyards, other wine\nregions and other local sources of information to make correct selections. Daniel Roberts, a\nconsultant in California, says that he tries to pick the coolest possible site that allows the grapes\nto consistently reach full maturity towards the end of the ripening season, allowing for full flavor\nand phenolic development. If a neighbor\u201fs Cabernet Sauvignon does not usually ripen until early\nNovember, that is a message that it may not be suited for your area.

When necessary, blend variety selection with a foundation\nof \u201csafe\u201d varieties with more challenging varieties.\nCorrectly matching variety to climate is\ncritical to fine wine production (chart\nprovide by Dr. Greg Jones, S OR University\n85\nClimate is not always the determining factor in variety choice. Control of vine vigor is\nanother important objective in Eastern viticulture, with the aim of getting the fruit and wood\nfully mature. On Long Island, where the climate is quite uniform on the North Fork, soil\nbecomes the critical factor. Soil composition, whether it is sand or marl and clay, will inform\nvariety selection, especially with red vinifera varieties, as will even small differences in\ntopography.\nFurther important viticultural characteristics to consider are disease resistance, growth\nhabit, vegetative vigor, fruitfulness, water and nutrient requirements (especially if dry-farming),\nand adaptability to the soil. Vinifera varieties are generally the most susceptible to disease and\npests, more cold tender, and often have the longest vegetative cycle, making them more\nchallenging to grow in a continental climate than their hybrid or native cousins. If sustainable or\norganic farming practices are a priority, then choosing the more disease-resistant hybrids makes\nsense. In a wet year they may only require half a dozen sprays while vinifera will need two to\nthree times more treatments. In general, site requirements are more strict and narrow for the\nEuropean varieties, so vinifera vines should be planted in the best sites and hybrids in the less\nfavorable (but still good) areas.\nThe marketing conundrum\nThere is a common saying in the wine industry that goes, \u201cPeople talk dry but drink\nsweet.\u201d The market reality in Pennsylvania is that the majority of wines sold are semi-sweet to\nsweet. This is the wine consumer who comes directly to the winery door. In the city and among\nwine retailers, dry wines dominate, but at the moment most of the Eastern wine industry does not\nparticipate in this wine market. Sweet wines are derived primarily from native varieties such as\nConcord and Niagara and hybrids varieties like Baco Noir and Vignoles. These are extremely\npopular in tasting rooms and festivals, and reflect the realities of the retail customer base in the\nregion. Dry wines made from vinifera varieties and the best hybrids like Chambourcin and Vidal\nrepresent a smaller wine consumer audience, but one that is growing rapidly. These are the\nwines that will garner the respect of the wine critics, restaurateurs and wine retailers whose\nstamp of approval is crucial to the wider recognition of emerging wine regions. With a few\nexceptions such as Riesling in the Finger Lakes or Merlot on Long Island, Eastern wine regions\nlack a varietal identity. This is due in part to the greater varietal diversity of the region, which\nmany claim to be an asset while others are certain that it is a liability.

For example, viticulturally Eastern growers are at a\ndisadvantage compared to colleagues in more arid regions, because they cannot field graft to\nchange varieties (too cold and wet). On the marketing side, a clear understanding of the\npreferences of the target market is needed before deciding what to plant. If the wines are being\nmade for sophisticated city wine drinkers, then vinifera-based wines are probably the logical\nchoice. If you are catering to rural customers, your wines should tend towards semi-sweet or\nsweet hybrids and natives.\nThe quality of your vines\nSome growers treat buying vines like going to the supermarket to buy milk. It is not and\nwill never be that easy. Two of our region\u201fs best wine growers said emphatically that the quality\n86\nof vine materials is one of the most important keys to a successful vineyard and that they would\ngo to any lengths to ensure their vines are the best they can buy. Think of the plant as a\ncherished infant that everyone wants to be healthy and well cared for from the moment of its\nbirth. In this analogy the plant nursery is the womb and a lot can happen there \u2013 good or bad \u2013\nbefore the vines are delivered to your farm. The long-term productivity and quality of your\nvineyard depends on the quality of the vine materials you use, but procuring the best plant\nmaterials is not an easy task, especially if you are looking for unusual clones and rootstocks.\nTo begin with, it may be hard to tell whether a vine is healthy or not. As with soil, what\nis not visible can be extremely important. In grapevines a complex of virus and fungal diseases\ncan affect the woody parts of plants and they are often propagated and disseminated in grape\nnursery stock. Major fungal pathogens of grapevines in the East include Eutypa, crown gall,\ntomato ringspot virus, leafroll virus, grapevine yellows, and Petri diseases, all of which can cause\nvine death. Vines often come \u201cpre-loaded\u201d with pathogens, which lay dormant until some\nenvironmental cue such as a stress (winter injury, water stress, mechanical injury, etc.) triggers\nthe symptoms. All of these maladies can lead to lower quality fruit, lower yields, and even\npremature vine death. Young vines are almost always more susceptible to pathogens than\nmature vines. Growers must protect and nurture their vines into maturity, when they will be\nmore tolerant and resistant to problems. The nurturing process begins by sourcing clean plant\nmaterials; then getting the vines established and into production with a sufficiently strong root\nsystem and vine structure to overcome biological and environmental threats.\nHow do you get a clean vine? There are currently vine certification systems based in the\nstates of California and Washington that serve the wine industry.

The plants are run through a rigorous quarantine and testing\nprocess to identify any problems, using sophisticated methods such as ELISA and PCR and a\ntraditional practice called woody plant indexing. The Northwest Grape Foundation Service also\nprovides clean and tested plants to nurseries participating in a certification program.\nClean vines are created using shoot tip tissue culture. They are then planted in a\nfoundation block, which is strictly managed and monitored to be pathogen-free. To satisfy\nindustry needs for a new variety, cuttings can be moved to an increase block in order to \u201cblow\nup\u201d materials to commercially viable amounts. Certified cuttings are then delivered to approved\ncommercial nurseries that keep their own sanitary and increase blocks to generate materials for\ncommercial distribution. Vines can be tested by foundation services and labeled as certified, but\nthis does not mean that they are sure to be free of all problems. They are less likely to have any\nof the pathogens designated on a list approved by the state Department of Agriculture. It is not a\nguarantee of total cleanliness. Instead, it assures the user that careful monitoring of nursery\nblocks is being performed. Conversely, a vine that is uncertified does not necessarily imply that\nit will be loaded with disease.\nThe commercial grapevine supply system is constantly being challenged by the incursion\nof known and unknown plant pathogens. Vines with problems are finding their way into\nvineyards. Every precaution should be taken by commercial growers to assure sanitary\nconditions at their vineyards and clean plant materials from nurseries. Unfortunately, many new\nvarieties and clones are either not available as certified vines, or only from California nurseries.\nCertified vines are more expensive, but considering the cost of losses in uniformity and\nproduction or the costs of replanting, they are worth the higher price. FPS and NWGFS are\nsuppliers of certified materials either directly to growers or via cooperating nurseries.\n87\nInvestigate their lists and find out which commercial nurseries stock their certified vines. At the\ntime of this writing, a consortium of Eastern universities, state and federal agencies, nurseries\nand industry associations are working to create a regional foundation plant service that will\nprovide clean vine materials to the commercial grape industry in the East.\nRegardless of variety, when dormant vines arrive from the nursery they all look alike.\nUnfortunately, it\u201fs impossible to look dormant nursery stock and determine its varietal identity.\nThat is why time must be invested in developing a relationship with a nursery can be trusted.\nPlanting a mis-identified variety is not a good way to start a vineyard.

If you suspect that Pinot Noir is Gamay, or Pinot Blanc is Melon, or SO4 is really 5C,\nyou may want to bring in an expert to make a positive identification.\nUsing suitcase or bootleg material from anywhere outside of the U.S. is not only a stupid\nidea, it is also illegal. Smuggled materials can bring diseases, viruses or insect pests into\nvulnerable vineyards. Before the dangers of pathogens were fully appreciated, phylloxera and\npowdery mildew, which are indigenous to Eastern North America and are two of the worst\nscourges in viticulture, were exported to Europe, and then California with devastating effects.\nThere is a formal procedure for importing grapevine materials into the U.S. It is expensive and\ntime-consuming, but really the only way for you to get new varieties into the U.S. and also keep\nour plant material resources secure. The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service\n(APHIS) works with FPS and Cornell University to import plant materials.

The University of Minnesota\nhas released both red (Marquette and Frontenac) and white (La Crescent and Frontenac Gris)\nvarieties that are already experiencing commercial success. Elmer Swenson, a grower and grape\nbreeder in Wisconsin, developed a long list of hybrid varieties, many of which are now being\ngrown commercially. These vines can survive to temperatures below -30\u00ba F and do not have to\nbe buried in the winter. They tend to show greater disease resistance and their vegetative cycle is\nshorter than other hybrids and vinifera varieties. They are quite recent arrivals, however, so the\noptimal viticultural practices (such as trellis and training systems) for them are not yet fully\nunderstood. It would be wise to taste their wines before planting them.\nTraditional inter-specific (French) hybrids such as Vidal Blanc, Seyval, Chancellor,\nMarechal Foch, and Chambourcin can make wonderful wines, often better than their vinifera\ncousins in some locations, and they may be especially well adapted to blending with vinifera or\nother hybrid varieties. Varieties developed at the New York State Agricultural Experiment\nStation in Geneva such as Cayuga White, Traminette, and Noiret have been successfully\nestablished as commercial wine varieties. Native varieties like Concord and Niagara still form\nthe base of wine production in the East and can make very fine wines for summer sipping. They\nmeet popular taste and can also be grown in colder areas.\nRootstocks\nRootstocks are one of the more mysterious aspects of viticulture, but they are crucial to\nfine wine production. Although out of sight, they should not remain out of mind. Unlike the\nvariety or clone, rootstocks do not have a direct influence on wine characteristics such as color or\nflavor, but their indirect effects can have a significant impact on quality. They may be the most\nunder-utilized, under-appreciated, and yet critical viticultural tool available to wine growers.\nRootstocks can determine the survivability of your vines and the ultimate quality of the wine\nthey produce. Their main purpose is phylloxera resistance but they can also influence vine size,\nthe vegetative cycle, and adaptation to the soil chemistry and physical characteristics of the site.\nOne of the main objectives of any site evaluation is to provide the information necessary to make\nthe correct rootstock assignment.\nRootstock numbers can be confusing but they are important and you should take time to\nbecome familiar with the primary commercial wine rootstocks. The default rootstock in the East\nis 3309C. It grafts well, is widely available, typically demonstrates moderate vigor, and is\nreputedly resistant to some nematodes. However, it is not always the best choice. New growers\nshould investigate the wide range of rootstocks available and the viticultural characteristics of\neach that could enhance grape quality. Eastern soils are generally fertile, cool and humid, so a\nrootstock like Ripara Gloire or 101-14 might be selected to exploit or mitigate these conditions.\nThere are many other rootstocks to choose from, but we still lack experimental data on which\nones may be more suitable for a particular soil or area. Some very good rootstock work has been\ndone by Dr. Terry Bates at Cornell University in Western New York, comparing rootstocks,\n89\nvarieties and soil pH.

For the present, carefully study the data and\ncharacteristics from other areas and meet with local growers who have tried different rootstocks\nin order to determine what will work best on a particular soil and site.\nRootstocks are important for their viticulture effects, but their first duty is to protect the\ngrapevine from soil-borne diseases and pests. In the case of Vitis vinifera the primary enemy is\ngrapevine phylloxera. Take the time to learn about this root louse, which has done more to\nchange the face and economics of the wine industry than almost any other organism. All vinifera\nvines must be planted on phylloxera-resistant rootstock if they are to survive and produce fruit.\nMost inter-specific hybrids with vinifera parentage such as Traminette may benefit from being\ngrafted onto phylloxera-resistant rootstocks. In addition, some rootstocks offer resistance to\ncertain nematodes, which can help to prevent the spread of some grapevine viruses, although the\nexpression of this phenomenon in the East is not yet well understood or documented.\nRootstock can offer other features such as a greater tolerance of drought, wet soils, lime\nand low pH soils. Some impart to the scion an indirect effect of lesser or greater vine vigor,\nwhich can affect the vegetative cycle of the vine. This is a major asset in high quality wine\nproduction in cooler climates when limiting the vegetative cycle of the vine is an important\nviticultural goal. A rootstock like Riparia Gloire and its clones, or 420A and 101-14 can regulate\nvine size and indirectly promote fruit maturity. In a wet, cool climate a few days may mean the\ndifference between harvesting grapes before or after a significant weather event, which can have\na dramatic effect on quality. When they are mixed and matched with the soil attributes, a\nbalanced, well-adapted and healthy vine that produces better fruit than an own-rooted vine may\nbe attained.\nProper rootstock assignment is not for the amateur or novice wine grower. The\nviticultural conditions and goals for the wine must be clearly understood if a rootstock is to make\nan imprint on a wine. A viticulture consultant familiar with who rootstocks perform under local\nconditions is almost a necessity to achieve successful results. Nursery websites contain good\ninformation and there are also some reliable reference books (see information resources).\nHowever, the best source of information on actual performance will always be the local growers,\nwho should be tapped for their knowledge.\nIn California the practice of field budding onto a rootstock that was planted the previous\nyear is widely used.

Phylloxera can kill\ngrapevines of the species Vitis vinifera. Phylloxera resistance is still the most important aspect of a grape\nrootstock. Pest and disease resistance provided by grape rootstocks is the central reason that we use them.\nThe rootstock is the primary interface between the scion variety and the soil, moderating the interaction\nbetween them. Rootstocks take up water and nutrients and provide them to the scion. The rootstock influences\nthe scion through increasing and decreasing scion vigor and vine size (among other influences). One goal of the\ngrape grower is to promote sufficient growth of the scion in order to reliably produce a suitable and sustainable\ncrop. Too much growth and the vines can be difficult to spray, pick, and prune. Not enough growth and the\nvine may fail to adequately ripen the crop. The goal is to reach a \"just right\" level of vine vigor and size.\nWe have only one opportunity to choose a rootstock for the vineyard, so in selecting a rootstock we\nshould focus on the key contributions that rootstocks make. Many management practices can be changed from\nyear to year \u2013 for example, we easily can install irrigation, modify fertilizer applications, and adopt new\napproaches to vineyard floor vegetation management. It is even possible to change the trellis and the scion\nvariety. As a guiding principle, rootstocks should be used for those things for which the cultural practices are\nexpensive, impractical, or unsustainable. For example, many rootstocks provide protection against phylloxera.\nWe would use these rootstocks instead of other management practices such as winter flooding. Rootstocks are\nan appropriate management tool when used correctly, but we need to recognize their limitations. Rootstocks can\nbe a blunt tool; for example, increasing or decreasing vigor is much easier to fine tune through irrigation than\nthrough rootstock variety.\nVineyard sites and rootstock varieties come in a range of vigor capacities. Since the site and the\nrootstock in turn influence the scion, the site should be considered when selecting a rootstock. Characteristics\nthat influence site vigor include effective rooting depth, soil chemistry, soil particle size, slope, water holding\ncapacity, drainage, precipitation, climate, and site history. Management practices that influence the site\u201fs\ncontribution to vine vigor and size include irrigation, fertilization, weed control, and structural modifications\n(such as ripping). Rootstock features that influence vine vigor and size include root architecture and\ndistribution, drought adaptation, nutrient uptake, and even the resistance to pests and diseases. Training and\ntrellising can help to direct the scion growth that results from a particular site and rootstock. Growers should\ntake into account the contributions of rootstock, site, and management practices when choosing a rootstock.\nComplement the contributions of the site and management practice with the rootstock that you select \u2013\nmanagement practices can be changed, but the rootstock choice is with you for the life of the vineyard.\nUnderstanding the capabilities and limitations of rootstock helps us to choose appropriately.

There is a widespread\nconviction that clones contribute crucially to\nwine quality. With arcane names like Swan,\nWente or Martini, or numbers like FPS 4,\nDijon 667, or UCD 108, the clonal landscape\ncan be very treacherous and confusing. Yet\nhaving the clones that winemakers favor or\nthat offer the best viticultural performance\non a site could be vital to grapes sales and\nwine quality.\nIt is often hard to measure a clone\u201fs contribution to the overall quality of a wine. Many\ngrowers claim that site expression trumps any discernable clonal effect. However, a few\nexamples in Oregon help to demonstrate the importance of clones. When David Lett brought the\nPommard and Wadenswil (from France and Switzerland respectively via the Foundation Plant\nMaterial Service at UC Davis) clones of Pinot Noir with him to the Willamette Valley in 1968,\nthey proved to be the perfect pair for the soil and climate of this new wine region. Pommard\nwith its smaller clusters produced rich, dark wines, while Wadenswil offered lighter style wines\nwith fresh and bright berry flavors. The two clones helped to put Oregon on the world wine map\nand continue to do so. With Chardonnay it was an altogether different story. Clone 108 (UCD 4)\nis a large and tight clustered clone of Chardonnay that was meant for warm growing regions. In\nthe Willamette Valley it rarely ripened fully and often yielded wines with aggressive acidity and\ntart flavors. Oregon, a cool region that should be ideal for growing Chardonnay, never gained\nfavor with wine consumers for this noble variety and, to this day, Chardonnay languishes in the\nshadow of Pinot Gris.\nThe choice of clone can make a difference, particularly for \u201cterroir\u201d varieties like Pinot\nNoir, Sangiovese, and Nebbiolo. Winemakers now fuss over Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot\nclones, almost as if there were a \u201cClone du Jour.\u201d In Bordeaux, the search for a better clone of\nCabernet Franc continues.

Hybrid and\nnative varieties are not propagated by clonal types.\nThe nursery\nOnce the varieties, clones and rootstock have been chosen, it is necessary to find the right\nnursery to supply them. The commercial grapevine nursery landscape is a minefield, so growers\nneed to proceed cautiously or else the long-term health of the vineyard may slip out of control.\nNurseries may be big or small, good or bad, they may have what you want or not, and all of these\nvariables could change from one year to the next. Buying grapevines is not like going to\nWalmart to buy clothing or a television. There is not built-in uniform consistency and quality of\nproduct. Nurseries are also subject to the weather and quality control issues. Some perform\nconsistently better than others. Any nursery order begins with a visit to the nursery\u201fs website or\nbetter yet, to the nursery itself. The nursery will usually provide ample information on its\nvarieties, clones and rootstocks, but qualitative assessments are more difficult to make. Grower\nreferrals are valuable but not conclusive. Check with local growers about which they like and\nthe quality of their materials, the success rates of newly planted vines, disease or virus problems\nexperienced, mix-ups of variety types, etc. It is also important to know who the best nursery\nsales representative is and to discuss your order with him or her directly.\nEastern grapevine nurseries tend to be smaller than their Western counterparts and they\nunderstand the region\u201fs growing conditions and vine material requirements better. However,\nthey sometimes do not have the latest vinifera clones and rootstocks. Western nurseries, which\nsupply large vineyards with tens of thousands of vines, on the other hand may not give a small\norder from the East quite as much attention as it deserves. The best hope for consistent quality is\nto develop a relationship with the nurseryman so that an order is not just a number on a piece of\npaper. If he senses the grower cares about the quality of the vines, the outcome will be more\nlikely sound plant materials. If you are placing a large order, one or two visits to the nursery at\nkey production moments like grafting and digging to check your vines may be a good\ninvestment.

The decision is made to plant variety X on clone Y and rootstock Z. At this point, if\nthe nurseryman says he does not have clone Y on rootstock Z, and only #2s, the prudent decision\nis to wait or walk. Do not let a nurseryman who has never seen the vineyard site decide what\nvariety, clone or rootstock will be planted. Never compromise the integrity of a vine order based\non availability. If a careful site analysis determines that Cabernet Sauvignon 337 on Riparia\nGloire will make the best wine then that is exactly what needs to be planted. If Nursery A does\nnot have it, then go to Nursery B and on down the line. If no nurseries have it then, do the\nhardest thing in the world for a new grower to do. Wait another year. Nursery production is\nguided by pre-orders of grafted vines, but most will produce a certain amount of \u201cspec\u201d materials\nfor the spot market. The vineyard is a 30-year plus project and it took a lot time and effort to\ndecide what will be best for it, so don\u201ft rush to plant or let an unknown person (often a\nsalesperson) dictate the future of the vineyard. It will handicap the wine by not getting the right\nand best vine materials from the start.\n93\nNursery orders are generally placed the year prior to planting for own-rooted vines and\n18 to 24 months ahead for grafted vines. In the cycle of grafting, a nursery cuts the rootstock\nand scion wood in the winter. It is then grafted and callused and in the summer planted in the\nfields to grow and establish roots. The vines are dug in the late winter and early spring, sorted\nand packed for shipping. The success of grafting varies with variety and rootstock type. For\nexample, the rootstock 420A is notorious for its difficulty to graft. Therefore, a percent of above\nthe needed number of vines should be ordered to account for failed plants in the field. Only the\nnursery\u201fs highest grade of plants, usually called #1, should be ordered.\nThe quality of plant materials from commercial nurseries can be maddeningly uneven.\nOne year Nursery A will deliver pristine vines and Nursery B will be awful and the next year just\nthe opposite may happen. Growers will sometimes feel frustrated in their efforts to source clean,\nhealthy vine stock. As a precaution and especially with larger vine orders, purchasing materials\nfrom two or more nurseries may offer some protection against large-scale failure in a new\nplanting. Then if there is a major problem with one block from a specific nursery but not\nanother, the nursery can\u201ft accuse you of incorrect vine handling and/or planting.

You will be incurring extra expenses, but according to some of our best Eastern wine\ngrowers it will be well worth it in the end.

The casual observer will not see all of the\ncomplex decisions that went into making the vineyard look the way it does. For example, why\nare vine row direction and length so important to the vine, vineyard efficiency and wine quality?\nDesign must be a blend of the practical, the functional and the aesthetic, with the emphasis on\nthose factors that will improve viticultural performance and the efficiency and ease of all\nvineyard operations.\nIn general, vineyards need to be more intensely designed for vinifera varieties and\nespecially the late ripening ones than for natives or hybrids, which are more forgiving and can\nmake good wine over a wider range of grape maturity. In designing a vineyard, not all varieties\nshould be treated in the same way. Red or white, variety and species \u2013 each has its own needs.\nVinifera varieties will be comfortable on a vertical shoot position system at higher vine densities,\nwhile hybrids thrive on a high-wire system at lower vine densities.\nConceptualizing the vineyard design should start the moment you begin to evaluate a\npiece of property as a vineyard site. Mike Walsh, one of the reviewers of this manual, has\ndescribed how he will spend hours sitting at various vantage points on an undeveloped site\nimagining how the vineyard might come together. He uses his sketches and notes as the basis on\nwhich to formulate a vineyard plan. Of course, this method is only possible because of Mike\u201fs\nyears of experience installing vineyards in California. Preliminary planning is even more\nimportant for complicated topographies and soils. The vineyard designer is immediately faced\nwith variables such row direction, block sizes and shapes, slopes, aspects, etc. Large, flat, single\nblocks of vines are ideal for vineyard operations. Two of the best wine regions in the East, the\nNiagara Peninsula and Long Island, enjoy a fairly uniform topography and produce very fine\nwines. Hilly sites are more challenging to develop and farm, but can offer highly distinctive\nwines.\nVineyard design is strongly influenced by the type of wine the vineyard is intended to\nproduce and the results of the site evaluation process which estimates the site capacity, potential\nvine size and the parameters necessary to achieve vine balance. These factors may be known by\nlooking at your neighbor\u201fs vineyard, otherwise, your design is the best educated guess based on\nthe available information you have collected and the intuition of experienced advisors.\nDesign parameters: Reconciling effectiveness with site factors\nThere are certain objectives that a good vineyard design must try to reach, including\nminimizing soil erosion, using land efficiently, facilitating all aspects of vine management and\nequipment operation, optimizing variety and rootstock performance (taking into account the soil,\nirrigation systems, and mesoclimate influences such as frost, freeze, wind direction, and other\npotential threats), and maximizing vineyard access, safety, and other considerations (including\naesthetics) that will be unique to your property.\nTopography will be a crucial factor to any design. A flat surface, even if sloped, is easier\nto work with than rolling, sloped surfaces. When planning a vineyard, safety should be a\nprimary concern. As a rule a vineyard should not be designed around the dimensions of farm\nequipment \u2013 as tempting as this may be, the result is likely to be an immediate and permanent\n96\ncompromise to potential wine quality.

Operational efficiency must be incorporated into the\ndesign. All of these decisions must be blended with the ideal viticultural design for the site.\nMuch of the viticulture component of vineyard design will depend on the wine that is\nexpected to come out of the vineyard (white or red), yield expectations, and style and price point\nobjectives. High-quality red wines tend to be the most demanding and this will be reflected in\nthe design and costs of the vineyard. In a mature vineyard the price point of the wine will\ninfluence how much viticulture (i.e., all the necessities for high-quality vineyard management)\ncan be purchased (see economics in Chapter 8).\nOnce the site evaluation is completed, a map should assign potential vine vigor to various\nsections of the vineyard. Vine vigor will influence the choice of trellis system and vine density.\nThe map will also play a central role in the design process, influencing not only the assignment\nof varieties and rootstocks but also block design and location. Once you have chosen your\nvarieties, clones and rootstocks (as a function of the climate and soil characteristics of your site)\nyou will have to decide where to plant them. It isn\u201ft quite as easy as saying, \u201cHigh value reds\nshould go on the top of the hill where the soils will probably be lighter, warmer and further from\nfrost,\u201d and \u201cCold tolerant white varieties such as hybrids should be planted at the bottom of the\nslope where soils are deeper and more fertile and cold air will tend to pool\u201d but general rules\nsuch as these apply to most vineyard sites. These decisions must be integrated with row direction\nand block size and shape.\nEven with all the careful planning vineyards their first iteration are a bit of a shot in the\ndark. If luck prevails the vineyard delivers on most of the expected results. But almost certainly\nwithin ten years the observant grower will have completely redesigned the vineyard in his mind\nand be awaiting the opportunity to tweak the original concept. Jim Law at Linden Vineyards is\nan excellent example of a grower who over the course of 25 years has learned every nuance of\nhis vineyard and is slowly tailoring it to achieve the proper varieties, rootstocks, spacing, vine\ndensity, trellis and row direction. There is no substitute for this kind of experience, based on\ncareful observation and endless tinkering. A vineyard continues to express itself over time. It is\na living and dynamic organism that is constantly changing and the shrewd growers learns from it\nand is constantly making adjustments to improve quality.\nTime is money, so the design should incorporate the best and most efficient practices into\nthe vineyard from the outset. Jan Waltz, a grower in Manheim, has learned over time that it\ntakes him 50% longer to cover a block with his sprayer if it is planted with short instead of long\nrows due to the extra turning required.

Flat, square fields are the\neasiest to farm but do not always offer the best terroir for wine.\nOther considerations that will affect your design are fencing, irrigation and drainage\nsystems, and other infrastructure such as roads, buildings, and work areas. All of these have\nspecific design and space requirements for their construction and use that may impact on other\nvineyard design considerations. They must be integrated into the vineyard plan in such a way as\nto optimize efficiency and performance and not hamper your viticultural imperatives. Headlands\nand alleyways around and between vineyard blocks should be incorporated to furnish plenty of\nroom for equipment operation. The standard is 30,\u201f and perhaps more if a mechanical harvester\nis used. Access roads and workspace are also important. Imagine where a flat-bed truck or\n97\nsemi-tractor trailer can be loaded and turn around with a load of grapes, and then work it into the\ndesign plan.\nDesigning your blocks: Row direction and other considerations\nRow direction is a crucial design feature that will be difficult to change at a later stage so\nit deserves careful consideration. It will be influenced by many local factors, especially\ntopography and orientation to the sun. For the sake of uniformity it is desirable to attain equal\nsun exposure on both sides of the canopy. A flat field, even if it is on a slope, has the most\npotential for correct row direction. East-west rows tend to ripen (and sunburn) fruit to a greater\ndegree on the south-facing side of the vine. The option on E-W rows would be to harvest the\nsouth and north sides of the vine separately. In the East, north-south rows are preferable in most\ncases to attain equal sun distribution on the canopy. The sun is usually less intense in the\nmorning than in the afternoon. Some growers are tilting rows 10-20 degrees towards the\nnortheast-southwest to obtain more direct sun exposure on the east side in the morning and a\ncooler aspect in the late afternoon and evening.\nThe question of row direction on slopes is constantly debated and compromises usually\nprevail. In the great wine district of Piedmont in Italy, rows run across the hills. In Germany,\nrows run up and down the hills of the Rheingau with some exceptions found on terraces. A south\nslope with rows running up and down is ideal, but there is greater risk of erosion. Going across\nthe side of the hill makes equipment operation more risky, especially under wet conditions or\nwhen using an implement such as a hedger, which raises the tractor\u201fs center of gravity. The\nnarrower the rows and the tractor, the more top-heavy the latter becomes. Planting across the hill\nmay also create terracing effects, further complicating tractor operations as well as control of the\narea between vines and the inside row on a terrace. However, terraces tend to hold soil moisture\nbetter than a flat slope. In all cases, cover crops will probably be necessary to hold the soil in\nplace.\nTerraces look spectacular and capture the imagination of wine lovers.

These are the vineyards that\nleave a permanent imprint on people\u201fs minds. In some cases terraces may be the only practical\nway to reclaim steep land for vineyards but they are difficult and expensive to develop and farm,\ninherently inefficient, and usually dangerous. It may be best to leave the terraces to those who\nhave spent generations farming them.\nAspect or slope orientation depends on many factors. As a general rule, south slopes are\npreferred. In Piedmont there is even a specific word, sori, used for a hill with a south exposure.\nA traditional method used by growers for centuries to identify potential vineyard sites is to note\nwhere the snow melts first on the hills, and these will usually be on a south slope. The Romans,\nas they marched north through France and Germany, always looked for south slopes \u2013 for\nexample, the bend in the Rhine River that now forms the Rheingau district, home to the great\nRiesling wines. This aspect captures the light well and allows for north-south rows running up\nand down the slope. As a variety reaches its climatic ripening limit, a south exposure becomes\neven more preferable.\nA west or east slope will require north-south rows to run across the hill, a practice in used\nin Piedmont. A north aspect is generally not favored, except in hot climates or to take advantage\nof natural protective features (for example, Lake Ontario for Niagara Peninsula growers) or to\nmitigate the effects of sunlight on certain varieties, whites in particular. Aspect and slope can be\n98\nimportant to vine survival in cold climates. Vines on south slopes may de-acclimate from their\ncold hardy condition during unseasonably warm days and be more subject to freeze injury as a\nresult. This is yet another risk factor that needs to be taken into consideration when designing a\nvineyard.\nIn a humid and wet climate like the East wind can be a desirable ally against disease. A\nbreeze that can help dry leaves from morning dew or an afternoon shower is an important\nsupplement to any integrated pest management program. While evaluating the row orientation\nfor different sections of the vineyard, take into account the wind and its prevailing direction and\nforce. There are some growers who will choose a row direction for optimal wind circulation\nover sun exposure. However, excessive winds can also inhibit photosynthesis (by causing the\nleaves to shut down to avoid water stress) and interfere with important activities such as\nspraying.\nRow length will vary according to the site features, but up to a certain point longer rows\nmake for more efficient vineyard operations. Jan Waltz explains that it takes 45 minutes to cover\nblocks with 500\u201f rows and 75 minutes to cover the same acreage with 200\u201f rows. Long rows are\nalso the most cost-effective to develop. Other viticulture texts state that 500\u201f rows are the\nlongest practical length. Runs can be longer if the topography allows, but should be broken up\nby alleys to allow crews and equipment (especially sprayers and grape bins) to enter and exit the\nfield, or to accommodate changes in soil (and possibly variety and rootstock).

Things to avoid are: swales and other\nlow, wet spots; overly steep slopes, woods; northwest to northeast slopes; areas that will be too\nhot or cold; fields surrounded by other agronomic crops (to avoid herbicide drift); sites near\nschools, businesses, and subdivisions; and soils that are too fertile.\nAt the end of the design process there should have a detailed map of the vineyard,\nindicating where every single vine (designated by variety, clone and rootstock) will be planted,\nas well as the vine density, trellis and irrigation systems, etc. This will serve as your road map\nfor the rest of the development process.\nSite capacity and the balanced vine\nA site has the capacity to produce a vine of a certain size that will be in proper balance.\nThe job of the grower is to determine this size and create a balanced vine. A balanced vine has\nthe best potential to produce high quality fruit. A simple illustration is the difference between a\nvine in California and Bordeaux. In the San Joaquin Valley Thompson Seedless vines on 100 ft2\n(12\u201f x 8\u201f spacing) of fertile soil can produce 50 pounds of fruit. In Bordeaux vines grow on 10\nft2 (meter by meter) producing about 3 pounds of fruit per vine. Why is there such a dramatic\ndifference in density and yield? Site capacity is a term used to describe the relative \u201estrength\u201f of\na soil as a function of its soil moisture-holding capacity and fertility. Strength is \u201cthe ability of a\nvineyard site to support vine growth and fruit production\u201d but does not imply that a strong site is\nnecessarily a good one. In general, the goal should be to plant the highest possible density that\nwill create and maintain vine balance. Natives and most hybrids can bear heavier crops than\nvinifera varieties and make the quality grade of fruit expected of them, but high quality hybrids\nlike Vidal and Chambourcin may benefit from crop regulation and tighter spacing. Site\ncapacity, to some extent, will determine the type and style of wine that can be grown. Keep\n99\nthese relationships between variety, balance, and density in mind during the vineyard selection\nand planning processes. Unfortunately, the only practical way to determine a soil\u201fs true capacity\nis to plant vines in it and see what happens. The first viticultural use of a site is always the most\nrevealing, but since vineyard projects are so expensive and enduring, every effort must be made\nto achieve balance from the beginning.

Generally, increasing\nthe vine density for red wines appears to improve wine quality. Once again, it is emphasized that\nthe terroir conditions should be closely matched to the intended wines.\nVine density and spacing\nDistance between rows determines quantity. Distance between vines determines quality\nDaniel Roberts, Integrated Winegrowing\nThis bold, yet simple statement applies to many premium-quality wine vineyards.\nBalance, harmony, equilibrium, and uniformity are words that free-associate well with correct\nvine density and spacing that encourage a balanced vine. But harmony is hardly the term that\nwould describe the heated debate among viticulturists on this topic. Whether referring to a big\nvine growing on 100 ft2 or a small one on 10 ft2\n, we want to keep these adjectives in mind when\nwe look at and measure vines. Yet there is\nlittle agreement today among viticulturists in\nany discussion about vine density.\nThis is one of the most puzzling and\nintellectually stimulating topics in\ncontemporary viticulture. Why are some\nvineyards in France planting up to 10,000\nvines (or more) per hectare (4,000/acre)\nwhile in the Mid-Atlantic region the average\nvine density is about 900 vines per acre?\nWhat could account for this amount of\nvariation? Is it a coincidence that many of\nthe great wines of the world come from highdensity plantings, and what exactly is high\ndensity anyway? Is there a distinguishable\nthreshold between low and high density. And what is the relationship between vine density and\nquality? The bottom line is, \u201ccan you taste the difference?\u201d Myths and misinformation about\nvine density abound in the wine industry. There are few hard and fast rules and little scientific\nevidence regarding the impact of vine density on wine quality, so it is important to gather\ninformation from trusted sources and apply it in the context of the considered site. This author\nbelieves that so far as correct vine spacing and density is a function of soil capacity, the best\nHigh density vineyard on the North Fork of Long Island\n100\nwines (and especially red wines) are produced from small to medium sized balanced vines grown\non soils with low to moderate capacity. It should be quickly noted that very fine wines can be\ngrown on larger vines but they rarely attain the quality level of the very finest wines. Your site\nwill tell you what spacing and density is most suitable to create a balanced vine. Follow that\nlead.\nVine density will dictate how many vines there are in a unit area, but it mostly represents\nthe three dimensional geometry of a vineyard. These are critical parameters for vine balance,\nproductivity, and wine quality. Vine density is a tool that can be used to adjust the grape yield\nper vine and per acre. As density increases, the yield per vine usually decreases but the yield per\nacre increases. The total root surface area per unit vineyard area also increases, resulting in\nimproved use of the available volume of soil. With a smaller amount of fruit to mature, each\nvine is better able to bring the crop to full maturity. Growers have observed that smaller vines\ntend to ripen their fruit faster, which provides an important advantage in a rainy harvest climate.\nIn the Mid-Atlantic, high-density red wine vineyards", "doc_id": "bb9c7fc2-f0c4-4e3e-9f46-03d1469693b2", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "9b3fd94977848e7a28ac0818795d907f480b2fd8886bcadfb6ea02de8021316f", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 442148, "end": 446267}, "relationships": {"1": "acd3b8f9-6274-4b01-8706-eb3b89775b72", "2": "2c066e40-62e6-4398-a3ec-c92558e24e81", "3": "ba9b8c84-367d-415f-8561-2c91a8ef77df"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba9b8c84-367d-415f-8561-2c91a8ef77df": {"__data__": {"text": "dictate how many vines there are in a unit area, but it mostly represents\nthe three dimensional geometry of a vineyard.

Growers have observed that smaller vines\ntend to ripen their fruit faster, which provides an important advantage in a rainy harvest climate.\nIn the Mid-Atlantic, high-density red wine vineyards typically harvest one to two weeks ahead of\nmore widely spaced vineyards in the same area. The degree to which this phenomenon is\ninfluenced by density or other factors such as vine age is unclear, but the trend is hard to deny. In\nthis context, density is a metaphor for all of the inputs responsible for the size of a balanced vine.\nGiven the harvest weather conditions of the East, picking a week or two early may offer great\nadvantages to wine quality. However, planting vines close together is not something you can\njust decide to do because you want certain results. It must be carefully planned based on site\nevaluation data that will suggest a density that is compatible with site capacity.\nProblems with incorrect vine density usually reside with the space between vines, not\nbetween rows. Shoot crowding to achieve vine balance can have many negative effects on fruit\nquality, in particular creating shade that will delay ripening and increase diseases and bud\nfruitfulness problems. We have all seen the results of too many vines in too little space, it\u201fs a\njungle. To some extent viticulture practices can make up for a vineyard\u201fs sub-optimal design\nfeatures but it comes at additional expense and frustration.\nVine density is one of those lasting decisions that you do not want to regret, so study the\noptions and try to get it right within reasonable limits. Fortunately, there are some measures that\nyou can take to rectify what may have been an incorrect decision. If more linear feet of trellis\nare needed for each vine, a vertical shoot positioned system can be \u201cbumped up\u201d to a divided\nsystem, such as the one devised by Scott Henry. If vines are planted too far apart in the row,\ninter-planting at a later date is possible. If the row width is too wide or too narrow, rows can be\ninter-planted or removed. In one striking example of changing an old vineyard\u201fs density in Napa\nValley - vines spaced 12\u201f x 8\u201f were turned 90o and inter-planted to a new 8 x 6 configuration that\nreduced the area per vine in half, which resulted in superior quality and yields. (Note that such\npost-planting measures should be avoided. This method avoided a complete replant but is\ncertainly not an ideal solution since it resulted in vines of great age difference. In much of the\nEast, where vine vigor is difficult to predict on virgin sites, the grower must conduct a careful\nsite assessment to estimate vine size and vigor. In Bordeaux you may see vines on meter by\nmeter spacing, but it cannot be assumed that this will work on more fertile soils, but it could lead\ninstead to crowding and shading problems that will affect fruit quality as was the initial\nexperience at Opus One Winery in California and Domaine Drouhin in Oregon. There is no\nformula for vine density, so you will have to take a reasoned approach guided by a careful soil\nevaluation and an estimate of site capacity.\n101\nDensities are increasing all over the world in vineyards that have been targeted for fine\nwine.

In Santa Barbara County, 6 x 3 has become the standard spacing for high-quality red\nwines and vineyards are experimenting with even closer spacing. In Barolo the vine spacing\nmay be as close as 50 cm (20\u201d) for Nebbiolo. Growers there clearly believe that that a\nqualitative relationship exists between yield per vine and wine quality, but this density can only\nbe applied if the site capacity will accommodate the closer vine spacing. There are early signs\nthat similar high density plantings may work in the Eastern U.S. as some growers push towards\nand past 2000 vines per acre but only less generous soils. The results of this reductionist wine\nformula are barely perceptible and yet practitioners (usually the most successful and wealthy\nones who can afford the high development costs) are convinced that it will produce a better wine.\nGrowers who do not reside in this rarified environment should consider the costs of developing\nand maintaining such a vine density are enormous, and the economic feasibility of the approach\ndepends on the price of the wine that is produced. If the quality improves so markedly that a\nwinery or customer is willing to pay more, then perhaps the investment can be justified. The\nreturn on investment of high-density vineyards requires careful analysis. Because of its\nadditional cost requirements, high density vineyards are often associated with estate vineyards \u2013\nthe additional capital from wine sales help to offset higher development and maintenance costs.\nIf high-density vineyards exist, are there medium- and low-density vineyards as well?\nThere are no exact boundaries but a low-density vineyard could be 12\u201f x 8\u201f (96 ft2\n/vine), a\nmedium-density spacing 10\u201f x 5\u201f (50 ft2\n) to 8\u201f x 5\u201f (40 ft2\n), and high-density spacing 7\u201f x 3\u201f (21\nft2\n) or less. Native and traditional hybrid varieties are often grown at lower densities, higher\nquality hybrids do well at medium densities, and high quality vinifera seem to flourish at high\ndensities, with premium red varieties in the tightest configuration. However, vine density is\nintertwined with many other site variables that can influence quality for better or worse. It\nwould be risky to generalize and assume that a certain level of density or spacing represents the\nfinal word on wine quality. Density trials can help to tease out the effects of vine spacing on\nquality, but in the end it is up to each grower to draw his or her own conclusions about the\neconomic, viticulture and wine quality ramifications of high- versus low-density planting.\nOne notable dissenter from the school of high-density viticulture and its\nrelationship to wine quality is Stephen Mudd on Long Island.

It is\nindeed a complex, multi-dimensional problem. Regardless of the density and spacing you opt\nfor, high-quality viticulture must be practiced to make it work. Density is just one element\namong many pre-plant decisions that will have a significant impact on quality. In matching a\nvirgin site to vine density, even the most experienced grower cannot do more than to conduct a\nfull site analysis and then make an educated guess. If it doesn\u201ft work, perhaps the next\ngeneration to farm the vineyard will get it right.\nRow and vine spacing\nBetween-row spacing must be determined by the height of the canopy and is driven by\nthe need to maximize production per acre. The more rows you can squeeze onto an acre of land,\nthe more grapes you will produce. Allowing enough space between rows is crucial for light\n102\npenetration, however, and the ratio of row width to canopy height (not total height) should be at\nleast 0.8 (Kees van Leeuwen). In the U.S. a 1:1 width-to-height ratio is common and usually the\nrow width will be slightly larger than the vine spacing. For a 6-foot-high canopy, the distance\nbetween rows should be at least 6 feet to allow the proper penetration of sunlight to the lower\nparts of the canopy and fruit zone in the early and later periods of the day. In Bordeaux a onemeter row width allows for an 80 cm (32\u201d) high canopy. Now that\u201fs really low!\nMany numbers and ratios have been calculated for optimal canopy, leaf and fruit\nmeasurements, but in the East a shoot length of 15-20 nodes or 36-42 inches is desirable to fully\nripen the fruit. Row widths in vinifera vineyards can vary from a tight 7 feet to a more typical 8\nto 10 feet. Row width must also accommodate your equipment, with at least 6 inches to either\nside of tractor tires or farm implements on a flat surface and even more on hillsides. If a divided\nhorizontal trellis system such as Geneva Double Curtain or Lyre is used, then an even wider\nspacing will be necessary. Anything below 6\u201f will probably require special and very expensive\nnarrow equipment such as over-the-row tractors. Decide on the optimal row width and vine\nspacing based on viticultural requirements, and then find the right equipment to fit those\ndimensions.\nIn-row vine spacing in the East for vinifera varieties will vary from 3 to 6 feet, with the\nwider 6-foot spacing being more suitable for fertile soils, white or high quality hybrid varieties,\nor older vineyards. Native and hybrid varieties are usually given more space to spread out; up to\n8 feet is not uncommon. The average for most vineyards is probably 5 to 6 feet. Most growers\nwould like 2-5 shoots per foot of trellis. This amount of space should be able to comfortably\naccommodate most varieties on typical soils in the Eastern climate. Close in row spacing will to\nvarying degree raise development and maintenance costs of the vineyard.\nTraining and trellises\nVine training and trellis systems are inseparable partners and while neither are\nnecessarily required in the first year of vineyard development, they are in the very center of the\ndesign process. Vine spacing can be influenced by trellis choice, especially if a horizontally\ndivided system like Lyre is used. An important consideration is the training method that you will\nuse.

If you are cane pruning, then the vines should be spaced no more than 5 feet apart, and\npreferably 3 to 4 feet. Cane pruning can reduce disease by limiting the amount of old wood on a\nvine. Long cordons are vulnerable to winter injury in cold regions and are harder to renew.\nTraining decisions should be decided now but will not be implemented until the second or third\nyear of development. There are many reasons to choose cane or cordon including bud\nfruitfulness, yield, and perhaps most importantly with many varieties, tradition.\nVine spacing will influence your training and trellis system choices. For high-density\nvineyards, the vertical shoot positioned system (VSP) is the only practical choice. For more\nvigorous sites, divided trellis systems such as the Scott Henry or the Smart-Dyson may be\nappropriate. Keep in mind that horizontally divided systems (e.g., Lyre or Geneva Double\nCurtain) need more space between the row than single vertical systems in order to accommodate\nmore foliage and equipment access. These are all important vineyard design considerations. Inrow spacing will also affect equipment use and efficiency. A grape hoe has a difficult time\ncleaning out weeds if the vines are spaced closer than four feet apart.\nDeciding on the correct trellis and training system to use is a good example of the\ncascading effect of site capacity on other critical components of vineyard design. Once the site\ncapacity has been evaluated and the parameters to achieve a balanced vine determined, then the\n103\nproper vine density and spacing can be assigned, and the most appropriate trellis system for the\nconditions of your vineyard and vines can be chosen. In a terroir with higher vigor, a divided\nsystem may achieve the best vine balance and fruit quality. If site capacity is in the low to\nmedium range, a single canopy system such as VSP is usually the preferred choice. A high cane\nor cordon with a single panel will require more between-row space than VSP because of its\nspreading umbrella configuration, which takes up more space between vine rows. Horizontally\ndivided systems certainly require a greater between-row distance, but even a vertically divided\nsystem will need some extra space.\nAs with most aspects of vineyard development, it\u201fs necessary to envisage how the\nvineyard will look several years hence and make plans now to establish a balanced vineyard\nsystem. The exact training methods do not need to be determined yet (we will consider this\nproblem in Chapter 16), but it can\u201ft hurt to start thinking, for example, about the relative merits\nof head versus cane versus cordon-trained vines.\nChardonnay on classic Vertical Shoot Position trellis, the most\nwidely used wine growing trellis in the US.\nMerlot on vertically divided Scott Henry trellis: note upward\nand downward growing canopy panels and two fruit zones \u2013\nwider spacing needed.\nNorton on horizontally divided Geneva Double Curtain: two\nside by side high wire trained cascading canopies with clear\ncenter aisle \u2013 widest spacing necessary.\n104\nChapter 13\nVineyard Infrastructure\nInfrastructure constitutes an important but under-appreciated aspect of a successful and\nefficient vineyard operation.

It includes all the non-viticultural support systems that allow a\nvineyard to function efficiently, safely and economically. These components are often not\nconsidered until the need arises, but careful planning of critical resources \u2013 water, utilities, roads,\nstructures, safety measures and so on \u2013 the smoother the operation of the vineyard will be. A\nuseful exercise is to imagine what it will be like to work under the worst conditions, such as rain\nduring harvest, and then design an infrastructure that will allow you to get the job done with the\nleast effort and risk.\nPreparing an infrastructure map that overlays the vineyard map will help to bring the\nentire vineyard system into clear focus, with its soils, varieties, clones, rootstocks, trellis\nsystems, rows and blocks, wells and irrigation system, buildings, roads, gates and fences, and\nother vineyard components. Together they will serve as the blueprint for the vineyard\ndevelopment project.\nCritical Needs (Water, Electricity, Roads and Work Areas)\nWater\nWater is needed for many purposes: irrigation, to feed different types of sprayers, and for\ncleaning, general health and safety. A reliable source that will meet all needs without fail even\n(and especially) in a drought year is essential to a smooth vineyard operation. Most vineyards are\ntoo remote to tap into a community water system, so a well, pond, stream or spring source will\nneed to be developed. Whatever the source of water it must be clean, with a pH and salinity and\nimpurity levels that are within acceptable ranges for all the uses planned for it, including\ndrinking water.\nDeveloping a water source can be as nerve-wracking and challenging as finding a good\nvineyard site. How is water found? Geologists and hydrologists can help to identify potential\nsources. There is the witcher (also called a \u201edowser\u201f), an individual who uses divining rods to\nfind thing that are hidden. Local growers or well drillers may be able to recommend a good\nwater witcher who will help to find the right spot to drill. The witcher\u201fs findings can be\ncrosschecked with those of a hydrologist. Looking at the existing water sources around the\nproperty could also be helpful. Once you find a place to drill, call in a drilling company with\nsolid references.\nDeveloping a water source can also be expensive. Drilling a well involves both art and\nscience and is something of a hit-or-miss operation. The cost of drilling is $5 to $10 per foot\nplus an additional $10 to $15 per foot for 6\u201d casing to bedrock. A dry well attempt can be a very\ncostly error. Ponds are helpful when large amounts of water are needed in a short period of time\n(e.g., for frost protection), but a lined irrigation pond may be even more expensive to put in than\na well. Assess the full portfolio of water needs and then develop a source with enough output to\nmeet these needs.\nElectricity\nVineyards are often located in remote areas and gaining access to electricity may be\ndifficult. While electrical power is not essential on every farm, it is certainly useful to have for\ntool and equipment operation. If electrical devices such as well or winery pumps require 3-phase\n105\nAC power it will have to be brought in or else an electrical power inverter must be used.

They should be designed to make work possible even\nunder sloppy conditions. Access to all areas of the vineyard will be necessary. Roads should be\nwide enough to accommodate the largest equipment that you anticipate using, for example a\ntractor-trailer semi. Most vineyards will have at least a few dirt roads, and dust and potholes can\nbecome a nuisance. Gravel roads are preferable and should be constructed properly using a base\nof 2\u201dminus rock under a layer of \u00be\u201dminus to provide a stable and durable driving surface.\nAttaching a blade to the tractor can help to maintain the road. Turn-around areas for trucks\n(including the tractor-trailers for grape deliveries) should be developed in appropriate sites\naround the vineyard.\nWork areas will be needed at harvest for loading and unloading trucks with grape bins.\nWherever possible these areas should be level and flat with a gravel surface (or a very durable\ngrass) to facilitate operations in wet conditions. Remember that it is extremely difficult to load\nfull bins of grapes onto a truck if the tractor tires are slipping.\nBuildings such as barns and offices are not essential, but using a pickup truck as an office\nis not a good solution. Record-keeping and information retrieval are vital to running a vineyard\nthese days, so it is important to have access to the internet, filing systems and means of\ncommunication, not to mention a comfortable place to rest and eat lunch. A small lab to run\ngrape samples during harvest can be helpful. It is also necessary to have a meeting place where\nclasses in worker protection standards can be conducted and EPA worker protection standards\nmaterials posted (emergency phone numbers, etc.).\nA big part of farming is using and maintaining equipment. Equipment, supplies and tools\nare the lifeblood of a farm and every piece, from tractors down to shovels and wrenches,\ndeserves a storage place out of the rain and sun. A proper facility, such as a pole barn with a\nconcrete floor and electricity, is essential to maintain the quality and longevity of your\nequipment. An open workspace with proper lighting and safety features will facilitate equipment\nrepairs. A dry, well-lit and organized storage area will help to extend the life of supplies and\nmake them easier to store and find.\nIn humid regions spraying plays an important role in grape growing. Significant attention\nshould be devoted to all aspects of spraying, from record keeping to weather forecasting and\nclean-up.

The novice grower may not\nrealize the damage that deer and other\nanimals can inflict on vines of all ages. Deer\nare everywhere now and they are very\nefficient in stripping new vines of their\ntender young shoots and mature vines of\nfruit. It\u201fs a shock to see all the leave gone\nfrom what was the day before a lush new\nvineyard. Fencing is expensive at $7 or more\nper foot, but deer (together with birds) will\nbe your greatest vertebrate challenges and\nprotective measures should be part of the\nvineyard budget. There are various options\nto exclude deer, but it is worth investing in a durable and effective exclusion fence, 8\u201f to 10\u201f high\nand installed by a reputable fencing company that goes around the perimeter of your vineyards,\nparticularly if there are wooded areas nearby. Ideally the fence will be partially buried to keep\nanimals from burrowing underneath and the mesh openings should narrow towards the bottom to\nexclude rabbits, raccoons and other smaller critters.\nIrrigation\nAs a rule too much water is a much greater concern than too little in Eastern wine\ngrowing. Just as having excess water can cause grape quality problems, drought conditions can\nimpair vine functions and also cause a loss of quality. In some vineyard applications, especially\nhigh value wines or extremely droughty soils, having irrigation makes sense. It can also be\nhelpful in establishing new, young vines, especially in dry years.\nIt is obvious that vines need water, but the question is when and how much, and should\none go for irrigation or for dry farming (farming without supplemental water)? New vines have\nlimited root systems, so water is needed to encourage vine growth. With irrigation available the\nvines may produce that all-important first crop sooner. Whether to dry farm or irrigate is a tricky\ndecision, one that is made all the more difficult by the expense of putting in a drip system,\nespecially if a water source has to be developed. The cost of such a system, considered on top of\nall the other development outlays, often results in it being kicked out of the budget. But since we\nare allowed the option of using irrigation (unlike many high-quality regions in Europe), it is a\ntool that should not be ignored.\nIrrigation is complicated and expensive to install and requires constant maintenance. In\naddition, there is very little information regarding the monitoring of soil moisture, and the proper\nuse and timing of irrigation for vineyards in the East. So why should a grower even bother?\nPerhaps the best way to look at the decision, as is so often the case in wine growing, is what may\nbe lost if something, in this case adequate water, is missing from the long list of necessities to\nproduce fine wines.

If the losses\nare then measured in retail value, it would not take much declassified wine at all to pay for any\nirrigation system. Irrigation is one of the many insurance policies that grape growers carry\nagainst the whims of Mother Nature. Others include frost prevention devices, deer fences, spray\nequipment, etc.\nMost vineyards in the East (including irrigated vineyards) are dry farmed and it must be\nsaid that this works well in most years. It is an irony of Eastern viticulture that so much effort is\ndirected at removing moisture from the soil (via soil drainage, artificial drain systems, cover\ncrops, etc.) whereas at other times it is necessary to add water. During dry years even mature\nvines, especially those on light soils, may need supplemental water to push them through to\nharvest. It should be noted that there are significant gaps in our understanding of water issues,\nincluding vineyard irrigation, in wet climate regions and few, if any cut and dried\nrecommendations regarding scheduling or best practices. Wine growers on Long Island may\nhave the most experience to share on the use of supplemental water for vines growing on sandy\nsoils. Furthermore, no one can predict how climate change will affect the need for irrigation in\nvineyards in the East in the future.\nElectrical power and an adequate water source must be available if you are going to\ninstall irrigation. A good drip irrigation system can cost upwards of $4,000 per acre to develop.\nIt is very important to design and install the system correctly, especially the underground portion,\nbecause once it is buried changes and repairs become very difficult. Most of the underground\nsystem through to the risers should be professionally installed. Unless you are a hydraulic\nengineer, decisions regarding flow rates, slope, block size, valve locations, etc. should be left to a\nprofessional. Water quality needs to be assessed and proper filters installed to remove impurities\nthat can clog the emitters and small orifices.\nThe amount of water needed will be determined by the size and design of the irrigation\nsystem. A water engineer from the irrigation company can provide a map of the irrigation\nsystem design. The characteristics of the blocks, slopes and other local features will influence\nthe design of the system. In the most sophisticated applications, double drip lines are used \u2013 one\nto supply each vine in the row and a second to supplement the main line for replants or weak\nvines that need more water.\nThe science of irrigation is still in its\ninfancy in the East, unlike more arid regions\nsuch as California and Australia.

Problems with electrical\nsystems, valves, clogged or missing emitters, leaks, and animals chewing on hoses above and\nbelow ground. Be prepared to spend a lot of time with the irrigation system.\nIf a well is being drilled or a stream is being tapped for water, the user should investigate\nlocal water usage ordinances and water rights carefully. While not as divisive a topic as it is in\nthe West, water is a limited resource so be sure that you are entitled to draw on the source\nnecessary for the irrigation system. The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service\n(NRCS) has information about local water rights, as do the county government and state water\nresources department.\nDrain tile\nDrain tile and irrigation can be used as complementary tools to fine-tune the performance\nof a vineyard. In some years you may need one or the other, and in rare years both. But their\nmain purpose is to provide the grower with flexibility and options in manipulating vine growth.\nExcess soil moisture, especially at the wrong time in the growing season, can be\ndetrimental to grape quality. The level of soil moisture that is desirable depends somewhat on\nthe style and type of wine you are trying to grow. In the case of high-quality hybrids and\nvinifera, moderate water stress after fruit set and before veraison can help to moderate shoot\ngrowth and improve berry ripening. These viticultural characteristics can also enhance potential\ncold hardiness. It is helpful to have a good understanding of the amounts and distribution of\nsummer and autumn rainfall in your vineyard\u201fs mesoclimate. Soil texture and slope will have\nthe greatest impact on the drainage ability of soils. The goal is to remove excess water quickly\nfrom the surface and the effective root zone of the vines. A soil will drain to field capacity by\ngravity, but the roots will still have access to water. Draining the soil still further, towards the\npermanent wilting point, will create the mild stress that is wanted after fruit set and near\nveraison.\nPlant-available water (PAW) is the measure of the soil moisture available for root uptake.\nThe soil is almost always well charged with water in the spring when rain is plentiful. During\nthe summer PAW fluctuates with rain events and water infiltration. This is difficult to control,\nbut using drainage tools and irrigation it is possible to influence the amount of water in the\neffective root zone of the vines. A soil evaluation will be the most important factor in the\ndecision whether or not to artificially assist soil drainage. If the soil is primarily heavy clay with\nslow drainage, it could benefit from tiling.

A good\nexample of the widespread use of tile drainage is in the clay soils of the Niagara Peninsula.\nHere, virtually all of the new vinifera vineyards are installed with tile in every row middle.\nDrainage tile has been shown to be very cost effective as it allows for better root growth,\nquicker vineyard access to perform critical tasks such as pesticide applications during periods of\nhigh pest pressure, access for harvesting in the fall, and a method of reducing soil compaction\nand other structural problems. In Ontario laying tile down the center of each travel row (8 feet\nfor laterals) has resulted in higher quality fruit and higher yields over many years. A moderate\nincrease in production (\u00bd ton per acre) can easily pay for the costs of installing the tile.\n109\nExcess water can be removed from the vineyard\nusing surface and subsurface drainage. Shallow surface\nchannels, drop inlets and storm drains are able to divert and\nremove large quantities of overflow water. They all rely on\nthe topography and proper drainage routes to move water off\nthe property.\nThere are different ways of installing drain tile. A\ntypical subsurface tile drain will consist of 3-4\u201d perforated\nflexible pipe wrapped in landscape cloth and laid in a 2-3\u201f\ntrench on a bed of gravel, which is then covered with gravel\nand buried, all with the correct pitch and drainage outlet. In\nOntario, a large machine digs a channel and tile is laid and\ncovered all in one process. The distance between tiles is key\nto the proper performance of the system and should be\ndetermined by a hydraulic engineer. The design, and usually\nthe installation, ought to be carried out by professionals to\nobtain the best results. The local NRCS office will have soil\nconservation personnel who can assist with the evaluation and design of a drainage project.\nThere are also private companies that provide this service. Drain tile should be installed after the\nvineyard is designed, but when the open field is still available. It should be clear to the designer\nand installer that the area being drained is a vineyard, not a field of row or cereal crops. All\nlateral tiles should run in the rows and end at a main that is large enough to carry excess water to\nthe proper outlet or ditch. Do not install laterals across rows, especially if you are possibly going\nto subsoil periodically.\n4\" drain tile ditch with a layer of river rock\n110\nTile Drainage in Vineyards in Ontario, Canada\nHugh W.

However, in many grape areas of Ontario rows are run north-south because of the sun location and\ntopography. The practice is to install tiles in line with the grape rows because this is more practical for\nrepairs and is less likely to result in grape anchors hitting tile lines.\nTheory says to just tile the wet areas and not the drier areas so you can save money.

You will want to have a clear plan and to be as methodical and careful in\nyour site preparation as you would be for the seedbed of a garden.\nFields that are open and clear are generally easy to convert into vineyards, while those\nwith variable contours are more challenging. The rough boundaries of the vineyard and the\nspecific blocks of vines should be marked for the various steps that precede planting, from\nputting in deer fence, drainage and irrigation to the soil prep work and lay out. The surface of\nthe field should be smooth and uniform. The subsurface should be free of chemical and physical\nimpediments.\nThis is the one moment in the life of a vineyard when it will be a clear field. Among the\nfirst decisions is when to install the trellis and vines, irrigation system, surface drainage and\ndrain tile. This will directly affect when and how the field can be prepared. Once posts, wires\nand vines are in the ground, the working space will be severely restricted so now is the time to\ncontrol weeds, cultivate and amend the soil, and install underground irrigation and drain tile if\nnecessary. These site preparation steps should be carried out in the summer and fall before\nplanting.\nSpecialized equipment\nThe first stages often require specialized equipment in the form of tractors and soil\nconditioning implements such as rippers, plows, discs, and harrows, which demand more\nhorsepower than the typical vineyard tractor can muster. This is not necessarily equipment that\nany new grape grower will want to purchase due to its price and limited use. A source of suitable\nequipment and operators needs to be found before development can move forward. Usually row\ncrop farmers will own some larger farm equipment. An excavation company will have tracked\nvehicles and ripping implements.

If lime needs to be applied, there are specialized lime\nspreaders, which are very large machines with balloon tires that require a lot of space to operate.\nLime should be applied according to the type and amount specified in the soil evaluation.\nAnalysis of the soil for pests and pathogens\nThere is usually an economic imperative to get a field into production as quickly as\npossible, but the long-term benefits of reducing harmful soil pathogens, chemicals and other\npotential problems could provide greater rewards \u2013 both financially and qualitatively \u2013 over the\nlife of the vineyard. If the field was previously planted with vineyards or orchards it should be\ncarefully analyzed for soil pests. It will be a great advantage if the field can be left fallow for 1\nor 3 years to recover from an extended period in monoculture. Soil-borne pathogenic fungi and\nbacteria can also build up over time in vineyards and orchards, and a new vineyard will benefit\ngreatly if you manage to reduce these populations during a fallow period. Soil testing can guide\nthis decision. Of special concern are nematode populations, which can be high in sites\npreviously planted with vineyards and orchards, especially older ones. If a soil renovation\nprogram is adopted (see Wine Production Guide for Eastern North America), this will require\nthat the field be left fallow for the period of treatment.\nDepending on the type of crop previously grown, such as corn, soybean or Christmas\ntrees, there may be a concern about residual herbicides in the field, such as Atrazine or Poast, in\n113\nwhich case a program of charcoal neutralization may be needed. Checking with the farmer who\ngrew the previous crop could bring to light possible problems. Be aware that pesticides and\nother materials can also drift into vineyards from neighboring fields.\nClearing the land\nLand clearing is an arduous and often expensive process, especially if deforesting is\nnecessary. The job of cutting and removing timber, and pulling up and burning stumps is better\nleft to experts. Because the work can be dangerous, it is recommended that a professional who\nunderstands the work and has the required permits be engaged to deforest. Depending on the\ntype and value of timber involved, some or all of the cost of its removal may be recovered.\nDon\u201ft let the crew leave until the results have been inspected and approved! Otherwise\nthere may be a large pile of smoldering stumps left to remove. As much as trees can be a\nproblem for wine growing, a few large trees can be left in strategic places for their aesthetic\nvalue or the shade they provide (the vineyard crew will appreciate this later). A forest cleared\nfor vineyard should be left fallow for 1 to 3 years before planting.\nKeep in mind that neighbors may be unhappy with trees being felled or any other changes\nto the landscape.

In general, low spots such as swales and gullies should not be planted. Small\ndepressions can be repaired to encourage drainage and discourage the pooling of water and cold\nair, which may result in cold injury to vines, in Ontario, this practice is widely used to mitigate\nfrost and freeze situations. However, the wholesale scraping, shaping or back-filling of large\nareas should be avoided, because even shallow scraping can have a dramatic effect on soil\nphysical and chemical properties. These effects, often in the form of weak or nutrient deficient\nvines, do not appear until after the vineyard is planted. If you are considering such measures or\nthey have been recommended to you by a consultant, then you should ask yourself why it is\nnecessary and how it will help to improve the vineyard.\nMany of the most spectacular and memorable vineyards we see are on terraced hillsides\nsuch as the Mosel or Hermitage. Most were developed long ago. Terraces demand great skill to\nform and maintain (requiring a tractor). They are generally discouraged for safety reasons\n(particularly on steep slopes over 30%) and because they represent a very inefficient use of the\nsurface area. Terraced vineyards make weed control and all vineyard operations more difficult\n(hedging, mowing, spraying, etc.). Vineyard slopes with rows across the face will tend to natural\nterracing with the use of cultivating equipment, which makes equipment operation easier. On\nvery steep terraces a tracked vehicle is the most practical for safe operations.\nSoil amendments\nNow is the time to amend the soil if testing indicates nutrient toxicity, deficiencies or\nother problems. If more organic matter is needed, the fallow period is a good time to plant the\n114\nfield with green manure-type cover crops (such as legumes) that can help to build up the soil\norganic matter to desirable levels. A stubble disc can be used to chop and turn under plant\nresidues.\nThis is the best time to adjust the soil pH. Lime/gypsum spreaders typically are huge\nmachines with large balloon tires designed to reduce soil compaction and \u201cfloat\u201d over wet fields.\nThey cannot, however, squeeze down an 8\u201f row. If added, the lime or gypsum should be\nincorporated as deeply as possible at the recommended rate.\nThis is also the time to add amendments such as compost and fertilizers where necessary.\nCompost can improve both the nutrient content and soil structure of a field. A soil or viticulture\nconsultant, along with a fertilizer vendor, can help to determine the products and rates necessary\nto improve a soil\u201fs health and condition. Apply them before or after plowing and discing so they\ncan be incorporated as deeply as possible into the soil. While you will be able to make minor\nsoil adjustments after planting, this is the ideal time to make major changes. Remember that it is\nbest to be conservative and not overdo any amendments \u2013 more in not necessarily better. Also\nremember that the main goal is to create and maintain a viticultural, not an agronomic soil.\nWeed control\nWeed control is of paramount importance and should begin during this site preparation\nphase.

Also\nremember that the main goal is to create and maintain a viticultural, not an agronomic soil.\nWeed control\nWeed control is of paramount importance and should begin during this site preparation\nphase. Weeds may be the most significant problem in new vineyards. They compete\naggressively for water, nutrients and light, and can temporarily or permanently hamper the\ngrowth and health of young vines. An open field is the best opportunity to control weed\npopulations before planting.\nThe type of vegetation on the site should be assessed and an appropriate weed control\nprogram designed. In timbered areas the weeds might consist of tough woody perennials such as\npoison ivy and blackberries, which are very hard to remove. But most fields will contain a\nstandard variety of grasses and/or broadleaf weeds. These can be eliminated with postemergence herbicides such as glyphosate products, applied with a boom applicator from a\nherbicide-dedicated spray tank. Herbicides can be very effective during the site preparation\nphase, even if there is no intention to use them late in the vineyard floor management program.\nAs a rule, the use of herbicides should be minimized as much as possible, and at all times\nchemicals should be delivered accurately and at the proper rate on targeted plants. The better the\nweed control is upfront, the less of a problem it will be later on. It is extremely difficult to\nimplement chemical and/or mechanical weed control around tender new vines in the first\ngrowing season. The foliage grows low to the ground and is very exposed to herbicide drift or\nmechanical damage.\nSome growers will elect not to use herbicides. In this case a field can be cultivated to\nremove weeds, but weeds are likely to reappear after vines are planted. Multiple passes with\ntillage equipment may be necessary before weeds are adequately controlled. If a field is\ncultivated for weed control, it will need to be planted with a winter cover to hold the soil in place\nduring the rainy season.\nSoil conditioning: Ripping\nOne grower interviewed for this manual stated emphatically that soil conditioning can\nmake or break a vineyard for its entire life span. Therefore great attention needs to be paid to the\nsteps involved in preparing the soil.\n115\nThe texture of the soil must be well understood \u2013 i.e., the proportions of clay, sand, silt,\nloam and rock \u2013 in the soil. This affects the moisture and workability of the soil and a correct\nevaluation will help to avoid soil compaction. There are tools that accurately measure soil\nmoisture, but farmers and soil scientists usually rely on their sense of touch and sight to\ndetermine relative moisture and whether a soil can be worked in or on.\nThere are many ways to cultivate a field prior to planting. The standard method is to\ndeep rip to 2-3 feet in two or three directions to break up any plow or hard pan that might impede\nroot development. This requires a large tractor or Caterpillar (D-6 or larger) to pull a long shank.\nIt is crucial to have proper soil conditions during this procedure. If the soil is too wet the blade\nwill simply smear and glaze a narrow channel through the soil, causing further root impediment.\nA dry soil may be too hard to drag a blade through it. An experienced operator will be familiar\nwith these conditions and will know that the soil must be relatively dry to the depth of the rip.\nSome vineyard", "doc_id": "72e52f2a-ead2-4bff-94d7-b9fedcd26eac", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "9dbbf5ae5e436aca86f5692a833cc72d6d5fc330b561f4f3a1d04916c439528b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 505994, "end": 509926}, "relationships": {"1": "acd3b8f9-6274-4b01-8706-eb3b89775b72", "2": "c59e4c00-331e-4c2f-b5e8-5725b06fb97f", "3": "fcc6b2e9-54c8-499c-ba6a-9d527dbee119"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "fcc6b2e9-54c8-499c-ba6a-9d527dbee119": {"__data__": {"text": "and whether a soil can be worked in or on.\nThere are many ways to cultivate a field prior to planting.

An experienced operator will be familiar\nwith these conditions and will know that the soil must be relatively dry to the depth of the rip.\nSome vineyard developers now employ a winged-plow directly on the vine row that lifts and\ncrumbles the soil at a uniform depth, which will allow the even distribution of roots for all vines.\nPractitioners claim that this practice builds uniformity in vine size, especially if the proper\nrootstock is used. The winged plow is a\nspecialized piece of equipment and may have\nto be custom-made. Alfred Cass, a soil\nscientist in California, has written\nextensively on the use of the winged plow.\nVine rows should already be planned\n(usually by GPS) before ripping begins. Soil\ncompaction should be analyzed and avoided.\nYou should monitor and try to minimize soil\ncompaction during all of the preparation and\ninstallation processes. Only if the soil\nevaluation reveals a uniformly distributed\nfield of good texture and structure, then\nripping may not be necessary.\nInstalling drainage systems\nThis is a good time to install surface water drainage systems based on the plans drawn up\nby the county USDA soil and water conservation office or environmental engineers. It may be\npossible to catch and retain run-off to provide irrigation water. Even if the field is relatively flat\nit is worth having it mapped by GPS for elevations, and its hydrological features evaluated for\nsurface and subsurface drainage needs. The more water that can be removed quickly from the\nsurface after a heavy rainfall, the less water will penetrate into the soil and root zone. Obvious\nwet spots in need of drainage should have been determined in the soil and site evaluation\nprocess, as these will have an impact on your development budget.\nDrain tile can also be installed at this time. Try to find a tile installer who has experience\nwith agricultural projects. Drain tile is employed extensively in heavy soils such as clay to assist\nwith water removal and aeration of the soil. It is widely used in the Niagara Peninsula region\nwith good effects on vine performance and quality. Aerial photography is an excellent way to\nmonitor the effects of drain tile in a field. There are many important decisions to be made when\ninstalling drain tile, such as depth, pipe size, the distance between tiles, drainage direction, etc.\nWinged plow for on vine row ripping helps soil and vine uniformity\n116\nAll of these should be determined by a professional. It is necessary to have the final layout of\nthe field planned beforehand to ensure that the drain tile is installed properly in the row middles.\nThe Natural Resources and Conservation Service can assist with all drainage projects and refer\nyou to professional installers.\nPests\nIf nematodes have been identified as a potential problem, now is the time to treat the\nfield. There are effective chemical nematicides registered for use in new vineyards, but these are\nnot widely utilized or preferred. Soil fumigants can have a devastating effect on the living soil,\nkilling the good as well as the bad. A less invasive alternative is soil reconditioning with grasses\nsuch as Sudex or canola, whose roots exude a mild toxin that suppresses nematode populations.\nThere is a very specific protocol that must be followed for this process to be effective and it\nshould be done the year before the spring of planting (see the information resources", "doc_id": "fcc6b2e9-54c8-499c-ba6a-9d527dbee119", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4b36995d3bdc8accf2b5b6d1a50300a7776b0ae88b23b46e2314bc80f2b5ffce", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 509988, "end": 513967}, "relationships": {"1": "acd3b8f9-6274-4b01-8706-eb3b89775b72", "2": "72e52f2a-ead2-4bff-94d7-b9fedcd26eac", "3": "859335c1-1cb7-40b8-97df-3470d4717f6d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "859335c1-1cb7-40b8-97df-3470d4717f6d": {"__data__": {"text": "middles.\nThe Natural Resources and Conservation Service can assist with all drainage projects and refer\nyou to professional installers.\nPests\nIf nematodes have been identified as a potential problem, now is the time to treat the\nfield.

As with ripping, the soil conditions must be right, which means neither too dry nor too\nwet. After plowing, the goal is to break up large clumps into smaller and smaller sizes. The next\nstep is to disc the field in two directions. Ripping, plowing and disking can be done in the\nsummer/fall prior to planting. A spring tooth harrow will prepare a field for seed.\nIn the fall, a winter cover should be planted. The type of cover crop used depends on its\npurpose \u2013 whether to simply hold the soil in places or to provide \u201cgreen manure\u201d to the field.\nAnnual grasses like rye and oats will establish quickly and hold the soil in place through winter\nrains. Legumes can provide nutrients to the soil.\nIn the spring the cover can be plowed under, followed by cultivation with a spring tooth\nharrow and then a cultipacker or drag tool to create a smooth surface with dirt clods less than one\ninch in size. While rotovators create an aesthetically pleasing, flat, clean field, their pulverizing\naction destroys the soil structure and therefore is not recommended for use in vineyards at any\ntime. Excessive cultivation can increase erosion, and decrease organic matter and permeability.\nAfter cultivation the field should be free of dirt and plant clumps, and flat enough that a line can\nbe laid on the surface without interference from debris.\nIt\u201fs not a common practice but some growers plant vines directly through the existing sod\nin the field. In these cases it is recommended that herbicide strips be established along the vine\nrow before planting to moderate the amount of competition from the cover crop. Irrigation\nshould be available, especially in case of drought.\nLaying out and marking the field\nDuring the site evaluation process a vineyard design map was generated that lays out\nblocks with rows, varieties, clones and rootstocks according to the soil and climate. Now it is\ntime to draw that design on the ground.\nIf a laser planter is being used, there is little need for a detailed layout of the blocks on\nthe field since the planter itself does this by GPS as it is driven. But if a vineyard is being\nplanted by hand or by other planting device, it is necessary to have clear guidelines just to be\ncertain that the desired configuration and straight rows are achieved.\nThere are many ways to lay out a vineyard. If multiple blocks of uneven dimension on\nvariable terrain are involved, this can be complicated and a professional surveyor should be\n117\nhired. If the fields are relatively flat and the blocks are not too irregular in size and shape, the\nlayout can be done with a surveyor\u201fs transit, a few tools (marking flags, etc.), and the trained eye\nof a skilled operator. With GPS it is possible to lay out a field exactly as it was designed on\npaper. In all cases, a block begins with a reference corner and side from which a first row is\nmade - usually a road, fence, tree line or any well-defined feature that can serve as a guide.

Once\nthe base line is set, the rows can be shot at 90s from this line with flags to mark their position.\nPopsicle sticks or plastic knives make perfectly good (and inexpensive) vine markers.\nFinal checklist\nBefore planting, the following should be made ready: trellis materials and installation\nequipment; plans for above-ground irrigation installation, testing and scheduling (if not a drip\nsystem, then some other contingency watering plan in case of drought); fertilizer with rate and\ndistribution plans; mulching materials and a method for dispensing in the field; a strategy for\ntraining new vines (unless you have decided not to train); rabbit and deer protection in place;\ndisease and insect pest control plan in place with materials, rates and sprayers ready; weed\ncontrol methods (chemical and/or mechanical); the necessary labor for planting or a\nmachine/laser planter, and of course, the proper labor and supervision to insure that the work is\ndone properly.\nProperly prepared field, marking with flags and ready to plant\n118\nChapter 15\nPlanting\nFrom the nursery to your vineyard\nArrangements should be made with the nursery to receive the vines just a few days up to\na week before planting. This is where a good relationship with the nurseryman will pay\ndividends. Nurseries usually want to get materials out of their warehouse to their customers as\nquickly as possible, but they have proper storage facilities and conditions, whereas farms\nprobably do not. As soon as the vines leave the nursery they belong to the grower, so it\u201fs better\nif the nursery is responsible for them for as long as possible.\nIf the vines are coming from California or some other distant nursery, the timing and\nconditions of shipping are critical. Many nurseries will want to air-freight the live plants but this\ncan be very expensive. In March/April the weather can be variable, so monitor the forecast and\ntemperatures to find a cool window to ship in. Dormant vines do not want to get stuck in a truck\nor warehouse without climate/humidity control when an early heat wave hits. Everything must\nbe done to ensure that dormant vines arrive with very tight buds.\nRequest instructions from the nursery about how the plants should be stored, prepared\nand planted, and follow these instructions closely. If there is a problem after the vines are\nplanted, you want to be able to say that you followed their instructions to the letter. It would be\nprudent to document what preparation and planting procedures you followed in notes and\nphotographs.\nThe vines arrive\u2026\nDormant plants come from the nursery as own-rooted or bench-grafted, and will be either\nbare rooted or in small pots.

Then they\nshould be sorted for efficient planting and\nstored in a cool, dark, moist area (inside a\nbarn or under dense tree cover). If bare\nrooted vines need to be stored for a longer\nperiod, place them in a covered grape bin\nwith moist sawdust and find a cold storage\nfacility to hold them for the necessary time.\nIf they are bare rooted and not boxed, they\nshould be buried in moist (not wet) sawdust.\nQuality control on the plants\n(especially grafted ones) can be done at this\ntime. Now is when you should cull out any\nvines that do not meet minimum standards.\nInspection and testing of new dormant benchgrafted vines is\nessential before planting\n119\nPerform a quality check on at least a few sticks in each bundle (see Chapter 11 on plant\nmaterials for criteria). If any of these conditions are not met, the vine should not be planted. It\nseems like every grower has an idea of what constitutes an acceptable dormant grafted\ngrapevine. Root number and length can vary greatly between nurseries or even between batches\nfrom the same nursery, but as a general rule, the more and longer roots on a vine, the better.\nBetter to trim roots than wish you had more. The rootstock should be properly disbudded at the\nscion should have two or more buds. Rootstock and scion diameters should be a closely matched\nand a minimum of 3/8th inch. The nursery should be contacted right away if serious quality\nproblems are found. The graft union should be given a flex test in different directions, using\npressure to bend the rootstock and scion between fingers and thumbs. Weak grafts will break\nalmost immediately and should be counted for replacement.\nOne of the worst things that can happen to a vineyard is a mix-up in materials occurring\neither at the nursery, during shipping or just before planting. The problems that this can cause in\nthe field do not require explanation. Nothing can be done about mistakes made at the nursery\nsince dormant vines are indistinguishable by variety. But at the vineyard keep materials well\norganized and clearly labeled. Planting days are often chaotic and it is very easy to mix up\nbundles.\nPreparing for planting\nThe day before planting, the roots of bare rooted vines can be soaked in water for 24\nhours. A large trough or tub is good for this purpose. If possible, one day\u201fs worth of vines\nshould be treated. If the roots are too long they probably need to be pruned. When you are using\nlaser or machine planting to set the vines, this will be necessary for the machine to operate\nproperly. Even if the vines are being hand-planted, they should be pruned back to a \u201creasonable\u201d\nlength (see the Planting section, below). The general rule when you are selecting your root\nlength is that when planting the vine, you have to dig a hole that is deeper than the length of the\nroots.\nCheck the weather and the condition of the soil before planting.

It is neither fun nor\nsensible to plant in a muddy field. The soil should be moist, but neither powder dry nor sticky.\nIt should not stick aggressively to a shovel blade. If planting conditions are correct, the quality\nof the work will be much better and the job will go faster. Sunny, hot weather can dry out the\nexposed roots of a vine that is left lying on the ground for just a few minutes. Keep the vines in\nwater right up until they are planted.\nThe scion will vary in length depending on the nursery. Often it is a two-bud scion,\nwhich will yield two shoots in the spring. You should retain both of these. Sometimes there will\nbe more buds, in which case you need to decide how many to leave. This will depend on your\nfirst-year training method; for example, whether you are going to start training with two shoots\nor let the new vine \u201cbush\u201d with many shoots. This topic will be discussed in more detail in the\nsection on first-year management (see Chapter 19).\nPlanting high-quality vines is a critical component for developing uniformity in the\nvineyard, and you should aim for a successful new vine \u201ctake\u201d of 95% plus for grafted vines and\neven higher for own-rooted vines. If your take is low and more vines are not immediately\navailable to plant, then your vineyard will be starting out with vines planted in two or more\nseasons, which will upset uniformity. Having a sound vine only gets you halfway to a uniform\nvineyard. Adopting correct planting techniques is equally important.\n120\nPlanting\nThis is where an idea is transformed into a vineyard and it is a very exciting moment.\nHopefully the weather will cooperate and allow the planting to proceed on schedule. Planting\ndays are generally long and hard and there is a lot to do and think about, so the more you can\nprepare ahead of time the easier it will be. Mix-ups in the barn or field of varieties, clones and/or\nrootstocks will be frustrating and costly. There are many ways to successfully plant a vine, but\nfew single operations in the life of a vineyard are as important and so it must be done correctly.\nA great deal of effort has been expended to get a healthy vine, so don\u201ft jeopardize the investment\nby falling back on sloppy planting technique.\nIf the conditions are right for a laser planter, this is probably the most effective and\nstress-free planting method available. Like all machines, laser planters work best on flat and\nbroad surfaces. Hilly, uneven and rocky sites pose more of a challenge. Laser planters use\nsensors and geographic positioning system (GPS) technology to plant straight rows with vines\nthat are equidistant in the row and aligned precisely up and down, across and diagonally in the\nfield. The result is a perfectly configured vineyard that is well worth the added expense of\nhaving a professional plant the vines.\nMost laser planters charge by the number\nof vines and rows, plus a travel/set-up\nfee.

It\u201fs a good idea to send photographs of the field\nbefore he comes to make sure that it is properly prepared.\nTree planters are not recommended unless you can get a highly skilled and experienced\noperator. These planters tend to wander off line and leave hourglass rows, uneven vine spacing,\nand variable alignment across the field. If they hit a rock they will jerk out of line, which is very\nhard to correct. They work best on flat, even terrain with few or no rocks.\nA backhoe should never be used to plant vines, nor should any \u201cmixing\u201d of soil occur\nduring the soil preparation or planting process.\nHand planting is still a very practical and effective way of getting vines established. It is\nthe only way to plant a vineyard if the trellis and irrigation systems are installed before planting.\nHand planting is quite labor-intensive and must be done properly. Planting teams should include\na hole-digger, a person with a 5-gallon bucket of water and vines who will plant and tamp, and a\nperson to follow them for quality control.\nA sturdy narrow-width planting shovel should always be used. A post-hole digger will\nalso work. Sharpening the digging edge will make the job easier. A proper hole should be dug;\nA laser planter gives straight rows in all directions\n121\ndo not simply use the shovel as wedge, rocking it back and forth to make an opening. A plug\nawl such as those used for planting Christmas trees is not a good planting tool for vines. Power\naugers are acceptable if the soil conditions meet certain specifications. If the ground is too wet,\nthe auger may glaze the soil and create an impenetrable layer that could inhibit root growth. If it\nis too dry, the soil cannot be lifted out of the hole properly. Augers can be either hand-held or 3-\npoint mounted and PTO-driven on a tractor. They are slightly faster than hand planting but are\nnoisy and smelly. A 4-6 inch bit is okay in most situations. A 12\u201d bit is too wide and requires\nextra work to dig and fill and will often settle too much.\nThe hole only needs to be wide enough to get the plant in vertically, and deep enough so\nthat all the roots are pointing downward.

If a vine scion roots, then\nthe rootstock may die, leaving the scion directly or own-rooted and hence exposed to phylloxera\ninjury. Constant monitoring after planting to prevent scion rooting will be necessary, especially\non vines that are hilled up to prevent winter injury.\nThe roots must be positioned downward and there should be some space between the\nends of the roots and the bottom of the hole. Do not \u201cJ-root\u201d the vines as this will inhibit growth.\nTrim the roots if they are too long for the depth of the hole. The roots of plants from the nursery\nmay vary in length and number. A #1 plant should have 6-12 main roots that are 12\u201d to 24\u201d long\nwith a good fibrous mass. Nobody wants to dig 2-foot holes, so root pruning to 12\u201d is perfectly\nacceptable. However, to establish a healthy vine, try to use as much of the original root mass\nprovided by the nursery as possible. If you make a 12-inch hole, fill in 3 to 4 inches and then\ntamp down with a device (a 12 x 2 x 2 inch stick is a good tool) to pack the soil around the roots.\nThen fill in another 3 to 4 inches and tamp, and repeat until the hole is filled to slightly above the\nsurrounding surface line, so that the soil can settle evenly.\nVery specific instructions followed by a demonstration and constant monitoring and\nquality control will be necessary when working with an inexperienced planting crew. Even an\nexperienced crew must be checked regularly to make sure that their work meets your standards.\nRotate the members of the team (diggers and planters) periodically so that the work is evenly\ndistributed. This is hard field labor, so using family and friends is not recommended except for\nsmall hobby plantings.\nRegardless of whether machine- or hand-planting is used, the vines must be set in a\nstraight line. They should not wander away from the center line or lean away from the vertical\nplane of the row. This will be crucial later on to the efficient operation of equipment, especially\ngrape hoes, herbicide booms, tunnel sprayers, mowers and harvesters, which prefer vines to be\nproperly lined up. Hoes and mowers will take out vines that are off-center and harvesters will\nnot work as well. Achieving proper placement begins with planting and will continue during\nvine training.\nMost or all soil amendments should be done before the vines are planted, but nevertheless\ngrowers put all kinds of material in the planting hole at this time, including fertilizer, compost,\n122\nwater absorbent materials, and mycorhizal fungi.

It is important to understand exactly why an amendment is\nbeing added to the planting hole instead of during the site preparation phase. Consult a\nknowledgeable soil expert when in doubt.\nTiming\nThe timing of planting is extremely important. Probably the most critical considerations\nare soil condition and spring frost. Unpredictable weather in the spring can make both of these\nissues real nail-biters. If you have vines and a crew or laser planter ready to go and it rains, you\nare faced with a tough decision. A wet soil will not pack as well around the roots, often leaving\nair pockets that will dry out the roots later. If the soils are too dry and irrigation is not\nimmediately available, the vines will suffer from water stress. The ideal soil in the root zone will\nbe moist and somewhat crumbly in the fist. This should be checked just before planting begins.\nHopefully climate research during site evaluation will have yielded an approximate last\nfrost date for the site, after which it will be relatively safe to plant, but there are no guarantees.\nEfforts to find a site with minimal frost risk will begin to pay dividends here. However, if new\nvines do get frosted, secondary shoots will likely push. A dry-farmed vineyard should be planted\nas early as possible to take advantage of spring soil moisture. You do not want to plant too late\nin the season either. Planting in June or July reduces the amount of time the vine has to develop\nduring that summer and the time it has to harden off for winter. Fall planting should be avoided.\nChecking your vines\nNo matter what type of planting method is used, make sure the vines are properly and\nsecurely set in the ground at the correct depth. The vine should be standing straight up in the\nrow center with the graft union situated about 3-4\u201d above the ground, with the soil well packed\naround the roots, which should all be in the downward position. It is important that your workers\nplant the vines correctly, because it is very hard to make adjustments afterwards. Quality control\nmust be maintained during the entire planting process to ensure good take and uniformity.\nMaintaining an accurate record of the various components of each vineyard block is\nessential to develop a history of the vineyard and track any vine problems that may develop after\nplanting. A detailed map of the planting should be drawn up that specifies all of the\ndistinguishing components of a given block including variety, rootstock, clone, nursery, date and\nmethod of planting (if more than one is used) and any other data relevant to the history of that\nblock. The original map almost always gets lost or so wet and dirty that it becomes illegible, so\nit is a good idea to make additional copies and store them in a safe place. The original nursery\nidentification tags can be used to mark changes in variety, clone and rootstocks across the\nvineyard. Numbered and labeled end-post tags bearing this information will be helpful to crews,\nwinemakers and vineyard managers.\nYou now have a vineyard! You are a wine grower. Now you can start nurturing the\nvines towards fine wines.\n123\nChapter 16\nTrellis and Training Systems\nThe French viticulturist Dr. Alain Carbonneau invented\nthe Lyre trellis system.

He explains the importance of the vine\ncanopy, and by extension the trellis, very simply: \u201cThe choice\nof the canopy is part of the taste of the wine.\u201d It is in the\nnature of most grapevines to grow upwards. If you go into the\nwoods you will see what prolific climbers the wild vines are,\noften stretching well into the tops of tree canopies. They are\nseeking light and if they have enough nutrients and water, the\nsky seems to be the limit. To tame this growth habit, for\ncenturies man has been cultivating vines on trellises.\nVarious trellis systems have been developed, based on\neither a horizontal or a vertical design. For many years the\nstandard system in California was a 2-wire vertical trellis,\nsometimes modified with a cross-arm. It couldn\u201ft be any\nsimpler (except for a 1-wire system). With the arrival of a\nnew bio-type of phylloxera and the downfall of the widely\nused but susceptible AxR#1 rootstock in the North Coast\ncounties, California sprawl has given way to a vertical shoot positioned (VSP) system that\nutilizes many more catch wires. This system accommodates a single, vertical canopy. A\nhorizontally divided system that will support multiple canopies, such as the Lyre and the Geneva\nDouble Curtain (GDC), are more complex and therefore more expensive to construct.\nIn the East, traditional trellis systems include the four-arm Kniffen, the Hudson River\nUmbrella, and top wire trained systems such as the modified Keuka High Wire and Geneva\nDouble Curtain. All of these have fallen out of favor in modern wine vineyard development.\nTrellis and training systems are closely linked in their development and use. The trellis\nsystem must accommodate the choice of training method. In commercial applications it is\nusually cordon training/spur pruning or head trained/cane pruning. Vine training directs the\nstructure of the vine to a desired form that will fit on the trellis. The most suitable trellis system\nvineyard should be determined by the site evaluation and estimated soil capacity and ultimate\nvine size. Vine size will impact planting density, which will guide trellis choice. For example, a\nhorizontally divided system like GDC or Lyre needs more space between rows (usually 10-12\nfeet) to allow for tractor access. On lighter soils in cooler areas the VSP may be the best choice.\nThe training system will be based on the variety, and the size and vigor of vines, local traditions\nand other considerations. The ideal trellis should be full, but not so crowded that the vines\ninfringe on the space of their neighbors. The standard for fine wine vineyards (with some\nvariations around the world) is the vertical shoot positioned system. It is important to determine\nthe most appropriate trellis system before the vines are planted, because downstream changes can\nbe complicated and expensive.\nClimate also impacts trellis choice. In warmer areas a system that spreads the canopy\nhelps to provide protective shade to the fruit zone and prevent sunburn. In cooler areas where\nmore sun exposure is desired to promote ripening and reduce problems with disease, the thinner\nVSP may be the best system. Local knowledge will help to guide your trellis and training\nchoices.\nLyre system has two vertically divide,\nupward trained canopies with a clear\ncenter area.

Note many wires.\n124\nIf soil capacity and vine vigor are unpredictable, a good option is to develop a trellis\nsystem that can accommodate both VSP and a vertically divided system called Scott Henry.\nThen if vine vigor is lower than expected, vines can train to VSP. If it is higher you can divide\nthe canopy vertically to Scott Henry or Smart-Dyson, redesigning the trellis to fit the larger\ndimensions of the system. Study the various training and trellis systems available and pick the\none that best meets your wine style goals and site characteristics.\nCanopy management will be one of the most important quality practices in each vintage\nso the trellis must support all canopy management objectives. No matter what system is chosen,\nthe purpose, design and strength requirements of the trellis system must be determined.\nReviewing practical vineyard guides such as Sunlight into Wine and the Wine Production Guide\nto Eastern North America, talking to vendors, and visiting growers who use a particular trellis\nare good ways to learn and will give you the opportunity to study working examples.\nConsiderations when choosing a trellis system\nThe trellis is what holds everything up so it needs to be well designed, built using the best\npossible materials, and properly installed. The trellis system is a reflection of the expected vigor\nof the site and the intended style of the wine. Big vines need a big trellis. Smaller vines will\nrequire less structural support. Some training systems, like the traditional head trained-cane\npruned method, are freestanding. Overhead trellis systems such as the pergola require very\nsubstantial support structures. The trellis system you choose must the right one for the particular\nvine training system you are using.\nOver time, certain trellis and training systems have been adapted to specific grape\nvarieties. Most native and some hybrid varieties are known for their downward cascading\ngrowth habit, and varieties like Concord and Niagara are almost always grown on a high wire\nsystem in which shoots are trained in a downward position. Inter-specific hybrids and the\nMinnesota hybrids are well adapted to a high wire cane or cordon system trained to 60-70 inches.\nVidal, which makes a superb white wine, appears equally comfortable on a high wire or low\ncane/cordon system. Single high-wire systems are less expensive to install and maintain, and can\nproduce very high quality fruit. Because of their downward configuration and wider girth near\nthe ground, more space between vines is required (usually 8-12 feet) and weed control may be\nmore difficult when the shoots reach the ground. Some hybrids grown for a higher price point,\nsuch as Chambourcin, are being trained to VSP to improve performance and wine quality.\nTradition and aesthetics can also play a role in trellis choice; over the years certain systems and\nvarieties have been matched, and usually for good reasons. Some people have a strong\npreference for the appearance of wood posts over steel. Nonetheless, it is important to evaluate\nthe options based on characteristics of the site and its particular needs.\nThe type of soil in your vineyard can affect the installation and performance of a trellis\nsystem.

Soil chemistry and moisture will affect\nthe longevity of stakes regardless of what they are made of. These factors should be taken into\naccount when choosing and installing a trellis system.\nMaterials\nVineyards are planted to last a long time and the trellis system must do the same. Pay\nclose attention to detail when choosing your materials and installing the trellis because this will\ndirectly impact longevity. A good trellis system usually looks like a good trellis system, and\n125\nwhile it will eventually disappear into the vine canopy, it must continue to do its job. Keep in\nmind that a well-designed trellis system will enhance the aesthetic appeal of a vineyard, which is\nnot an unimportant consideration, particularly in winter and early spring when the trellis is fully\nexposed.\nThe rule when selecting materials is: get the best and most durable components available.\nThe long-term nature of a vineyard demands this. Make no mistake about it, as with almost all\nproducts, there is good and bad design and quality in wire, stakes/posts and other trellis\nmaterials. . Replacing broken stakes and wire, fallen trellis and so on is frustrating and\nexpensive, and in the long run it will be cheaper to invest in high-quality materials. That means\nthe proper gauge (thickness) of end posts, line stakes, and wire; the correct length of dead-man\nanchor, high-quality training stakes, etc. This rule holds even if \u2013 or especially since \u2013 the price\nof everything from fuel to steel has been skyrocketing. Use some common sense rules to keep\nwithin your budget. Check prices frequently, order well in advance and if possible in quantity\nwith others, and make sure that what is delivered is what was ordered. The inexperienced eye\ncannot tell the difference between 12- and 14-gauge metal stakes, so use a micrometer to make\nsure that the proper gauge of wire or stake was delivered. Dealing with a reputable vendor will\nhelp you to get the correct materials, but will not guarantee it.\nEnvironmental conditions will affect the longevity of the trellis system. Soil factors like\nmoisture, salinity and pH can all shorten the working life of both wood and steel posts. Salt air\nin coastal areas may damage the trellis wire and other metal parts. Proper measures should be\ntaken against known threats. This could mean investing in more expensive materials, such as\ngalvanized steel stakes. The alternative is to replace parts when they are damaged, which can be\ncostly and time-consuming in a mature vineyard. If a trellis fails under high wind conditions, for\nexample, it will very likely be near harvest when a full load of fruit is on the vines. It is very\ndifficult to make repairs at this time and fallen trellis will disrupt harvest operations. This is\nwhere preventive measures can pay real dividends.

An\nimportant word of caution: CCA-treated posts that are being replaced should never be burned\nbecause of the arsenate content in the preservative.\nNon-commercial, self-made posts from locust or other local trees is not recommended.\nBesides not looking very professional, they are hard to install properly and can easily fail.\nSteel has recently been gaining in popularity. Steel posts will generally be about 2 inches\nin width, various thicknesses (gauge), stake design and notch pattern and whether you want\ngalvanized or non-galvanized steel. Every one of these factors will have implications for\ndurability, strength and wire placement. There are some very poor quality steel stakes on the\nmarket and these must be avoided. The notch positions on steel line stakes must be correctly\nspaced. Do not get stakes notched to the point where the stake enters the ground since this\n126\nweakens the stake at a critical location. The posts should be strong enough to hold a full crop\nand withstand strong winds.\nIn other countries fiberglass and concrete posts are used, but they are not readily\navailable here. For a specific canopy width, there is a specific width for the steel or wood post\nthat will best accommodate it. There are wire-holding assemblies that can space wires more\nwidely apart to accommodate a wider canopy, or you can simply use wider wood posts.\nFixed wires are attached to wood posts using galvanized staples and should allow for\nmovement of the wire for tensioning. Movable catch wires are attached using galvanized nails,\n\u201cJ\u201d staples, clips, or other types of wire-holding devices. One problem with wood posts is\nkeeping the wire fasteners in place, as they tend to work loose after a few years. Install them at a\ndownward angle and slightly off a vertical alignment. The fruit wire should be installed on the\nwindward side of the trellis.\nIn deciding the length of the stake, remember that they should be driven into the ground\nto a depth of at least 2 feet, and perhaps more in sandy or other loose soils. If the soil is too\nsandy, the post will always wobble, and only a cement casing will hold it fast. If the relative\nvigor of the site is uncertain, a 10\u201f line stake \u2013 3\u201f deep and 7\u201f above, just in case a decision is\nmade to vertically divide the canopy. This will offer flexibility to switch between VSP and\nScott-Henry. It\u201fs always better to have too much trellis than too little. Most VSP line posts are\n6\u201f high 20 \u201eto 24\u201f apart, but their placement should be dictated by the distance between vines,\nwith each post falling evenly between vines. Vines should not be placed next to a post,\nespecially if you are planning to harvest mechanically.\nIt is recommended to get wood posts with a pointed tip for ease of insertion.

Posts and\nstakes should be pounded or vibrated rather than augered to minimize wobble once they are in.\nEnd posts\nEnd posts and assemblies bear the brunt\nof the stress on a trellis and therefore should be\nstout but not over-built. Complex end\nassemblies usually fall apart over time and are\ndifficult to repair. The length of row will\nimpact the type of end assembly needed. For\nmost applications, a 5-6\u201d diameter wood post or\na round or angled steel end post with a dead\nman anchor will suffice. End posts should be\nplanted at least 3\u201f in the ground, and more is\neven better. Some vineyards drive 10\u201f end posts\n(wood or steel pipe) 4\u201f or more into the ground\nand forego the anchor. Like line posts, end\nposts should be pounded and not augered for\nthe best results.\nSteel end assembly with dead man anchoring system\n127\nEnd posts should be installed at the correct\nangle, typically 15-30 degrees from vertical. To get the\nproper alignment of a row of end posts, install them\nevery 10-15 rows and run wire from the bottom and top\nposition of each post. Use these wires as guides for the\ninside end posts while continuing to check the\nalignment with a level and by eyeballing the line.\nRemember that with a steel U-channel end post, the\nopen end should face inward or else wire attachment\nwill be very difficult.\nAnchors should be installed at the right distance\nfrom the end post and screwed straight into the ground.\nLarger diameter anchors are used in lighter sandier soils and smaller anchors in heavier, claybased soils. A simple straight bar is a good tool for installing anchors. There are attachments\nthat can fit on a PTO-powered auger to drive the anchors. They should go to full depth with the\nanchor loop or eye to ground level. Rocks are often a problem with anchor installation; it may\nbe necessary to move the anchor closer to or further from the end post until an unobstructed\npiece of ground can be found. Anchor wires should be at minimum the 12-gauge hi \u2013tensile or\nbraided wire for this use. A double-wrapped anchor wire can be twisted and tightened into a\nsingle wire with a metal bar. Some growers place a white PVC sleeve on the anchor wire to\nincrease visibility and help avoid equipment damage. Trellis suppliers and manufacturers such a\nGripple offer anchor systems that are designed for this vineyard application.\nInstallation\nInstalling trellis systems is a big job and usually very\ntime-consuming. The ease and pace of installation will depend\nto a large extent on the soil and topography of the site. A steep\nrocky field presents the most difficulties. Layout and\ninstallation are much easier on flat, sandy loam soil, as for\nexample on Long Island. A trellis or fence installation company\ncan be hired to do the work. It is important to have straight rows\nfor both practical and aesthetic reasons. Stakes should be\naligned both up and down the row, across the field, and\ndiagonally.

The placement of the stakes must be done\nmeticulously, whether or not the vines are already in the ground.\nUse a marker for the position of each post or stake.\nTrellis installation can be extremely hazardous. A post pounder exerts tremendous force\non a stake or post, and can cause it to split, splinter, shatter, or fly out of position. Strict safety\nprecautions should be taken during post installation. Hardhats, heavy work gloves, and eye and\near protection must be worn by anyone working near the post. Protective sleeves that separate\nthe post from the operator can be used. Get expert advice if you have never done this before, and\npractice on a few posts first. Post pounding by hand is hard work, but not quite as dangerous.\nUsing a vibrator to install metal\nline stakes\nWood end assemblies on Long Island\n128\nVibrating devices can be used to install metal stakes\nin soil that is not too firm. Find the method and\nequipment that will work best with your soils and\ntype of post.\nIn rocky soils, the posts or stakes may not go\nin easily. One option is to change the placement of\nthe stake, moving it up or down the row until a\nsuitable spot is found. Otherwise hand dig a hole\nand if the stake will not reach the proper depth, trim\nthe top of the stake to the proper height. On slopes\nthe stakes should be aligned to a vertical position\nregardless of the angle of the slope.\nWire\nTrellis installers develop a very close relationship with wire during long days working in\nthe vineyard. First and foremost, a word about wire safety. There is a rule in nature that the\nsharp end of a wire will always try to find an eye to poke. When working with wire, safety\nglasses and good gloves are an absolute must!\nWire, like your posts, needs to be strong enough to hold a full crop and withstand strong\nwinds. For an acre of 8\u201f x 4\u201f VSP with one fruit wire, two pairs of movable catch wires and two\npermanent wires, it will be necessary to unwind, splice and fasten over 38,000\u201f of the wire. Wire\nis essential and must be understood to be handled properly. It is wound under pressure into\nheavy spools usually weighing about 100 pounds or more. Because there is tension in the spools,\nthe wire will appear to have a life of its own and if not unwound properly, it will unravel and\ncause a tangled mess only comparable to a fisherman\u201fs worst nightmare. Once this happens, the\nroll must be scrapped. Use a \u201cspinning jenny\u201d to properly dispense the wire, with a man\ncarefully managing the wire as it comes off of the spool. Multi-tiered jennies can dispense more\nthan one strand at a time.\nWalking up and down the rows pulling wire is tedious and strenuous. However, using an\nATV or other vehicle is not recommended, because feeling the tension in your hand when a\ntangle occurs at the jenny is necessary to avoid calamity. Here\u201fs a helpful tip: whenever both\nhands are needed to work, stick the end of the wire in the ground to hold it fast.\nA lot of wire splicing will be necessary and growers usually have a distinct preference for\ncertain fastening and splicing materials and methods.

A double nicopress splice is very unlikely\nto fail. Regardless of the system you use, the correct crimping tool is necessary. Wire should\nnever be kinked or wound too tightly.\nWires need to be attached to their wood post or steel stake. A come-along with a wire\ngripping device is a crucial tool for tensioning wire in many applications. Other handy tools are\na fence hammer, vice grips, and heavy-duty wire cutters. Fastening and holding devices for your\nstakes, such as staples in wood, have to be strong and fast. Tensioning devices or wire strainers\nare often used on the fruit wire and sometimes the catch wires. The fruit wire should be\nfastened but not bound to their supports. Catch wires should retain freedom of movement for\nshoot positioning later on. In wood posts, and angled nail, J staple or plastic wire sleeve can\nhold the wire in place. The fruit wire will usually be high-tensile 12-gauge wire. Catch wires can\nbe lighter 13- or 14-gauge soft wire since they don\u201ft have to carry a load.\nProper equipment and method to install end posts\n129\nWire can come with various protective coatings. At a minimum be sure to buy highquality galvanized wire. Repairing broken wires in a mature vineyard is an exasperating job that\nyou must fervently hope you will never have to do. Using good wire can help to avoid this.\nFruit wires need to be fully tensioned to hold the weight of the vine and crop. Catch wires can\nbe more loosely tensioned, whether fixed or movable. Movable wires need to have slack to\nfunction properly. A common technique is to add a 24\u201d chain to each end of a movable catch\nwire, which can then be adjusted to a nail positioned at the appropriate height on a wood end\npost.\nHeight of the fruiting and catch wires\nThere is plenty of debate about the optimal height of the fruit wire for high-quality wine\nproduction. The standard on VSP systems in the East is 30-36\u201d. This allows for airflow below\nthe canopy to help dry it out from rain or dew and keeps the fruiting wood elevated enough to\noffer some frost/freeze avoidance. It also makes it a lot easier to move between rows (just try to\nsqueeze under a 20\u201d wire!) and keeps work in the fruit zone within easy reach.\nIf a high wire cane or cordon system is being used, the fruit wire position can be\nestablished at 60-72\u201d. A pair of catch wires may be placed about 2\u201f below the fruit wire to tuck\nthe canopy in; this will keep it from sprawling into the row and getting tugged by passing tractor\ntires.\nMany high-quality vineyards are lowering the wire for expensive red vinifera grapes to\n20-24\u201d, which is the practice in Bordeaux and Burgundy. The purported advantage is greater\nheat availability at the lower height, in terms of both reflected and radiant heat stored in the soil\nand released at night, which can help to push the vine\u201fs physiological processes. In higherdensity vineyards (typical of certain regions in Europe), to reduce the between-row distance the\noverall canopy height is lowered, thus necessitating a lower fruit wire. This approach has its\npros and cons. Having a low fruit zone may allow the grapes to pick up more heat, but it also\nplaces the clusters in a more humid and frost-prone environment and closer to splashing disease\nspores.

It would be worthwhile to research this point and talk to growers\nwho have experience with different fruit zone heights.\nPositions for wire placement can be studied in books such as Oregon Viticulture and\nSunlight into Wine and in established vineyards. Notched stakes have an advantage over wood\nsince they allow all the wire positions to be adjusted. The first catch wire is positioned about 12\u201d\nabove the fruit wire, the top catch wire about 6\u201d below the top of the stake and the middle wire in\nbetween the top and bottom wire. Some growers use three pairs of fixed catch wires for VSP,\nwhile others use two to three pairs of movable wires. There are many variations so seek the one\nthat is most comfortable and efficient.\nAll divided systems have their own peculiar wire position and numbers. For example, a\nvertically divided system like Scott Henry or Smart Dyson needs an overall height of 7\u201f to\naccommodate both the higher and lower leaf panels. The fruit wire is also moved up to leave\nenough room for the downward-trained shoots. The Lyre system with its two vertical panels\nrequires more wires than any other system. More wires mean more shoot positioning, which\nadds to the cost of maintaining the vineyard.\n130\nTraining stakes\nAs an extension educator I look for cues that a\nvineyard development project is serious and one is the choice\nof training method and materials. Training stakes are a\nrequirement in a high-quality wine vineyard. This is simply\nanother way of saying that straight trunks are a requirement.\nAs more and more vineyards are being mechanized,\nequipment such as harvesters demand straight trunks for\noptimal efficiency. A properly trained vine also looks a lot\nbetter. In young vineyards, the steel pencil rod training stake\noffers a stiff target for the sensor arm on a grape hoe and\nprotects the tender shoots. While bamboo stakes have been\nthe most common training stake for years, a rolled-steel\npencil rod or re-bar is much stronger and more durable and\ncan be reused in future fields. String training should not be\nconsidered a viable option.\nTraining stakes must be securely fastened to the\nfruiting or irrigation wire. Vines should be tied to the\ntraining stakes regularly, fastening them loosely with expandable material to prevent girdling.\nDo not use string, wire, ag-tyes or other non-expanding materials.\nScheduling your trellis installation\nWhen to install a trellis system depends on the timing of other parts of the vineyard\ndevelopment project. If the vineyard is being laser or machine planted, the field has to be left\nopen for tractor access and the trellis should be ready to be installed as soon as the vines are\nplanted. Sometimes growers will allow their new vines to grow out (in a bush shape) in the first\nyear and install the trellis in the winter or spring. However, allowing vines to sprawl on the\nground is not a good way to start their life. If drip irrigation is being installed, the trellis must be\nin the ground before or directly after planting.

Unfortunately, short supply lines, on-time inventory systems, and the lack of\nraw materials have wreaked havoc in the materials supply sector. The sooner an order can be put\ntogether with a reliable vendor, the better are the chances of receiving the materials on time.\nTrellis materials are heavy and bulky, and will often be delivered in large bundles on a\nflatbed truck. Be prepared to unload and store the material, and then to distribute it into the field.\nHave the necessary equipment and facilities in place to do this safely and efficiently. A proper\nwork area will greatly enhance the process.\nUse a proper training stake to create a\nstraight trunk\n131\nChapter 17\nEquipment and Technology\nIt is possible to grow wine grapes with very little equipment and technology. The need\nfor specialized equipment and technology increases with the size and wine quality goals of the\nvineyard. There are some tools and pieces of machinery, however, that are absolutely necessary\nto get essential tasks done in a timely and correct way. These represent the minimum\nrequirements that will keep everything going on the farm.\nThe tractor\nThe tractor is the heaviest, most expensive and most important piece of equipment that\nyou will own. It must have the power take off (PTO) and horsepower at the drivetrain to power\nup hills under heavy loads. Implements are rated for PTO horsepower. Make sure that there is\nenough available for the most demanding piece of equipment used. Many implements require\nhydraulic power and tractors need to be rigged for this application. All wheel drive will be\nnecessary for hilly sites. A positive-pressure cab with air-conditioning is highly recommended,\nespecially since a lot of spraying is necessary in the Eastern climate. In the absence of a cab, a\ngood ROPS (roll-over protection) system is a non-negotiable requirement. Purchase a tractor\nthat will fit comfortably into the row width you select; 6-12\u201d of clearance to the rear tires is\nnormal but slopes will affect this decision. The more slope (and especially side hill), the more\nwidth of row and tractor will be necessary.\nHow many tractors do you need? One to start with, but as the vineyard size increases to\nover 15-20 acres, a second tractor may be necessary to perform multiple and simultaneous\noperations. When the heavy spray season begins, it\u201fs very convenient to have a dedicated spray\ntractor. This can also serve as a reserve in case the first one breaks down. The second tractor\ncould be a used machine with less horsepower for lighter duty operations such as mowing.\nOn hilly sites many growers are moving to crawlers equipped with PTO and rubber\ntracks. These offer greater stability and much lower soil compaction, and some even come with\nsteering wheels instead of the traditional dual-lever steering system.\nVineyard sprayers\nThe vineyard sprayer will be another significant expense and there are many types and\nbrands to choose from.

Purchase a high-quality sprayer because grape disease will pose a\nserious problem in most years.\nIt is strongly recommended that growers read Effective Vineyard Spraying by Dr. Andrew\nLanders, a spray engineer at Cornell University. This book describes equipment and methods in\ngreat detail.\nA separate and dedicated herbicide sprayer and accessories are necessary for herbicide\napplications. Never use herbicides in a canopy sprayer for obvious reasons.\n132\nQuality (once again)\nReliability, durability and serviceability should be built into every piece of equipment\npurchased. In most cases, you get what you pay for. If the intention is to be in the vineyard\nbusiness for the long haul, purchase the best possible equipment and plan for the future. Underdesigned or poorly constructed equipment will lead to frustration and possible damage and safety\nhazards. Remember that, according to Murphy\u201fs Law, a piece of equipment will break down\nexactly when it is most needed, so potential service and repair costs should be a critical\nconsideration in purchasing equipment. How fast can a broken sprayer or tractor be turned\naround? In our climate a single missed spray application could result in significant crop loss.\nAccess to a backup tractor and sprayer is never a bad idea, but borrowing and lending equipment\nis to be discouraged.\nLook at what other growers are using and talk to them about the pros and cons of a\nparticular brand before deciding what to purchase. Visit high-quality vineyards and see what\npieces and brand of equipment they have, and ask who the best suppliers are.\nThe ABCs of purchasing equipment\nThere is a right tool for every job and finding these tools will make the job easier, faster\nand better. Most people persist in learning the hard way \u2013 by struggling, swearing, breaking\nsomething or worse still, hurting themselves by using the wrong tool or equipment. It is much\nmore sensible to select the right tools and materials in advance. In the long run they will be\nbetter, more durable and safer. Good tools and equipment deserve to be treated well, so protect\nthem by storage in a proper facility, from the tractor down to spare O-rings.\nOrder equipment well in advance of the time they will actually be needed. Many\nproblems, from supply chain shortages to dealer incompetence, can delay the arrival of a muchneeded tool or piece of machinery.

For example, two popular training systems \u2013 VSP and the HighCordon system \u2013 generally require 8\u201f line posts, with 2\u201f driven into the ground. Divided canopy systems\nsuch as Scott-Henry and Smart-Dyson require 9\u201f posts. If the grower suspects that his vineyard is a\npotentially high vigor site, or that the variety planted might be vigorous, a 9\u201f post may be better suited to\nhis needs. The additional 12\u201d of post would then be available should the grower later determine that he\nwants to convert his non-divided system to a divided canopy system. End posts, regardless of the training\nsystem, should be POUNDED at least 3\u201f into the ground. Studies performed at the Sunraysia\nHorticultural Center in Australia have concluded that end posts should be driven vertically into the\nground, not at an angle. Vertical end posts are stronger and easier to work with than angled end posts.\nSteel vs. Wood Posts\nWood posts have long been preferred in vineyard in the U.S. This could be due to the fact that\nuntil recently steel posts could not be easily obtained except along the West Coast. As they become more\nreadily available, the popularity of steel posts has increased significantly in many areas of the U.S. The\nmajor difference between steel and wood posts is the LABOR costs for trellis installation. Wood posts\ncan be up to 4 times more expensive to install than steel. This includes the costs not only of planting the\nposts in the ground, but also of the hardware necessary to secure trellis wire to the posts. Most steel line\nposts today have built-in wire slots for securing trellis wires.

As always quality, durability and having the right tool for the job are\nessential. For example, it isn\u201ft possible to install a trellis or tighten a fence without a good comealong. A hardware store hoe will last five minutes working in rocky soil. It would be far better\nto have a machine shop weld together a slice of a disc onto a steel handle.

If you do not obey this simple rule, somebody might get hurt or the\ntool may be damaged. Everyone working in the vineyard should make it a habit to return all\ntools to their proper place. Wasting time looking for tools can be a source of intense frustration.\nVendors\nA lot of equipment, materials and supplies are needed to develop and maintain a\nvineyard.

Specialty\nsuppliers to vineyards are few and far between, and you may have to drive a long way to find a\nsuitable tractor or sprayer; hence a lot of supplies and materials will be ordered through the mail.\nThis is one reason why production costs are higher in a developing wine region. Probably the\nbest way to locate a reliable supplier is to ask another grower in the area. With chemical\nproducts such pesticides and fertilizers, it is important that the vendor has the products you need\nand knows how they should be applied in vineyards. A knowledgeable vendor can be a valuable\nsource of information, although growers should remember they are of course trying to sell you a\nproduct. Local growers and industry associations will be your best source of information\nregarding the vendors servicing your area.\nTechnical know-how\nVineyard development services are not widely available in the East, but one should be\nengaged if your level of skill and knowledge are not yet developed enough to do the job correctly\nand safely. Development companies have the experience, equipment and technology needed to\ninstall a vineyard properly. For example, Mudd Vineyards, Ltd. has installed over half of the\nvineyard acreage on Long Island and they do very high quality work. Stephen Mudd and his\nstaff understand and know how to deal with local conditions and are tapped into the supply\nchain. Other companies may be available in other wine regions.\nA vast array of technology is available to help the grower enter the age of precision\nviticulture. It is possible now to manage a vineyard literally vine by vine. This starts with\nvineyard site suitability systems that draw on vast digitized climate and soil databases to evaluate\na site. Aerial and satellite imagery can be used for a variety of design and maintenance purposes,\nsuch as finding weak and low production areas in a vineyard. Overhead or side scanning\nsystems programmed for Normalized Digital Vegetative Indexing (NDVI) can reveal just about\nevery nuance in the canopy and assist with nutrient management decisions. Hand-held devices\ncan help the grower to record and access vast amounts of data about his vineyard, including the\nGPS coordinates of every missing vine and spreadsheets with spray records and phenological\ndata. Electroconductivity soil analysis systems make it possible to read the soil without even\ndigging a hole. Climate monitoring stations are getting more sophisticated and less expensive\nevery year. There are systems that will radio climate data to the computer in your house. There\nare even disease-modeling programs that can make recommendations based on the unique\nconditions of your farm, although cultivar susceptibility should always take precedence,\nespecially if you have many different cultivars planted in one location. Soil moisture probes can\nguide irrigation decisions and leaf wetness monitors may help with disease forecasting.\nMost of this technology is not yet practical or cost-effective for the scale of most Eastern\nvineyards. But as the industry grows and vineyards get larger, these gizmos and gadgets will\nbecome essential tools for the Eastern wine grower.\n136\nChapter 18\nVineyard Management and Labor\nThe fun part of starting a vineyard is the process of education", "doc_id": "6d0134c4-a630-4c6d-983e-2511eec390f9", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d2ccc1489783707bb03e586f755575ccee1aa9d8c6a6ba702c433703b2e73b89", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 596786, "end": 600994}, "relationships": {"1": "acd3b8f9-6274-4b01-8706-eb3b89775b72", "2": "92d0fd15-a8dd-45b9-87d3-cabdb21a7106", "3": "727add99-bc15-4b4f-8be4-28511ab84676"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "727add99-bc15-4b4f-8be4-28511ab84676": {"__data__": {"text": "and less expensive\nevery year.

The quality of the grapes will depend on the successful translation of information into\nresults, which isn\u201ft always easy. Concepts can be complex and, as stated earlier, there\u201fs usually\nmore than one way to do any task, interpret any data, or solve any problem. Labor issues are a\nchallenge everywhere in agriculture. Skilled workers are hard to find. Language barriers exist.\nMisunderstandings abound. Employer-employee relations can be complicated and fraught with\ndanger. But when a good team comes together to execute a sound viticultural plan, the results\ncan be remarkably gratifying \u2013 both on the vine and in the bottle. Without exception fine wines\nare the result of good management and labor.\nSmall, one-person operations are usually quite straightforward and easy to manage.\nLucie Morton estimates that one full-time person can take care of 4,000 to 5,000 vines, and that\nanother full-timer should be added for each incremental increase of 4,000 vines. Assigning labor\nneeds based on the number of vines rather than the number of acres makes sense, because it takes\ninto account the variability in vine density in the vineyard. In the case of smaller vineyards that\ncannot afford to hire a full-time crew, pooling the available labor and getting a crew to work a\nnumber of vineyards is a viable option. It is important to keep workers employed all year round\nor they will leave when they are not needed and may not come back. It is possible for more than\none vineyard to share a crew and still get all their tasks done in a timely fashion. Small\nvineyards in the East often rely on family and friends for help, but there are obvious\ndisadvantages to this strategy. Often they will be good for a day or two but not more, especially\nif they find themselves working in the heat, rain or cold.\nAnd the availability of family and friends should not be allowed to determine the date of\nharvest \u2013 the grapes make this decision.\nThere are work cycles in the vineyard that flow with the seasons. Pruning is often slow\nand steady. But even for pruning, there are different approaches. One is to hire a big contract\ncrew to come in and do the job very quickly, but this often means sacrificing the quality of work\ndue to the unfamiliarity of the crew with the vineyard. Alternatively, a smaller permanent crew\nthat knows the vines can move at a steady pace through the winter months and prune at a very\nhigh quality level.

The quality of the grapes will depend largely on how smoothly this\ncontinuum of research, planning, practice and eventual rewards unfolds.\n137\nIf the vineyard is small and you are the only pair of hands on the premises, the project\nwill be a labor of love. As the vineyard grows, however, it will be necessary to hire additional\nhelp to keep up. This is when the owner-operator needs to take a long, hard look at how he can\nmake the best use of agricultural labor.\nWine growing is a highly technical enterprise and complicated concepts must be\nunderstood, adapted to the unique features of a particular vineyard, and then translated into\ninstructions that end up as work. Ask any successful commercial wine grower and he or she will\ntell you that one component, and perhaps THE most important component of fine wine is a good\nvineyard crew and equipment operators. Experienced, reliable, hardworking, observant, and\ncreative \u2013 these are the qualities of a good crew and they have to be cultivated over time.\nTherefore, a serious vineyard owner knows that he must do everything possible to retain his best\nmanagers and workers! If consistency and uniformity of grapes is the hallmark of quality for a\nvineyard, then keeping the same skilled crew to do vital tasks such as pruning, canopy\nmanagement and picking can only enhance the quality of the fruit. A high turnover rate will, as\nit does in most businesses, lead to a decrease in productivity and quality.\nFarming used to play a large role in our nation\u201fs economy and culture but this is no\nlonger true, and very few people today can say that they grew up on a farm. Hiring teenage kids\nis generally not a good idea. The best workers are often Latinos with farm experience. They\nhave the right attitude and are used to the often physically demanding and repetitious work of the\nvineyard. There will be cultural differences to understand and take into account, but it is\ndefinitely worth investing time and effort to find the right people to tend the vineyard. They will\nbe relied upon more than can be imagined and the value of intelligent collaboration cannot be\nmeasured in dollars.\nProper documentation is required for each member of the crew. They must always be\ntreated fairly and with respect. Workers should be compensated at industry standards or better,\nbased on their experience and the quality of their work. Having a crew that knows the vines and\npractices will make operating a vineyard much less stressful, and will result in quality,\nconsistency, safety and other benefits for the vineyard. Over time the crew will learn what to do,\nand be able to do it without even being asked, so that the owner can spend more time on essential\ntasks away from the field.\nThis does not mean that the workers should not be monitored and evaluated. Even\nthough many of the tasks are somewhat menial, the quality of their work will impact fruit\nquality. If a worker is not planting a vine at the proper depth or is not removing the right number\nof leaves from the correct nodes on the morning side of the vine, the grapes will suffer. Constant\nvigilance is necessary, especially during the training phase. And never assume that just because\na crew is doing a good job at 9 a.m., they will be working to the same standard at 3 p.m.\nUltimately, it is up to the manager and the owner to maintain quality standards by hiring the right\npeople and working closely with them.\nThe crew: a genuine asset\nA typical vineyard crew will include a foreman who can lead the team in their", "doc_id": "022e447b-be06-428d-aecb-b044af19dbe5", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "f4f13532b75434cc74a789fa06c02547560176319674ab440836fbc2f0798400", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 605142, "end": 609250}, "relationships": {"1": "acd3b8f9-6274-4b01-8706-eb3b89775b72", "2": "727add99-bc15-4b4f-8be4-28511ab84676", "3": "3238c59b-3f60-4b44-85d0-73f31be37d0f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "3238c59b-3f60-4b44-85d0-73f31be37d0f": {"__data__": {"text": "does not mean that the workers should not be monitored and evaluated.

At the next level will be the equipment\noperators, or else crew members whom you know can be trusted to drive a tractor, fill and mix a\nsprayer, or operate a post pounder responsibly. The field hands can be divided into groups based\non their years of experience and the type of work they are doing, and should be paid accordingly.\n138\nThese are the people who will be in\nthe field day in and day out, and who will\ndevelop an intimate connection with the\nvines. What they see, feel, smell, hear and\ntaste in the vineyard matters to you as the\nmanager or owner of the vineyard. They\nshould be trained to scout for diseases, pests\nand other problems, and to tell you what they\nsee in a timely manner and without\nhesitation. The more clearly they understand\nwhat is required, the more useful information\nthey can gather and share. Sometimes\ncultural barriers will impede a worker from\ntelling his boss bad news, so crew members\nshould be told that it is alright to report\nproblems in the vineyard. The best leaders can become excellent practical viticulturists and will\noften have useful suggestions about how to improve vineyard practices, reduce costs and\nincrease quality. They should be encouraged to share their ideas.\nLanguage barriers and cultural differences form a part of multi-cultural workplaces.\nKnowing some conversational Spanish can be very helpful; indeed, Spanish is a core course in\nmany vocational viticulture programs. If the owner or manager is not conversant in the language\nof the crew, then a translator will be necessary; this would ideally be the crew foreman.\nInstructions need to be simple, clear and specific at all times. Every task must be\ndemonstrated several times, with the instructions reinforced and monitored continually during\nthe workday. Show the crew exactly how the hole should be dug and the vine planted or tied to\nthe training stake. Leave no room for misinterpretation of the instructions.\nFinding legal agricultural labor in the East is a challenge and one of the most significant\nproblems faced by larger vineyards. There is no book or agency that can help you to find\nagricultural labor. Probably the best way to start is by asking other commercial vineyards where\nor how they secured their labor. Often workers will have relatives or friends who are looking for\njobs. Labor contractors may be a source of workers, but great care must be taken in selecting a\ncontractor. Try to get a direct referral from another vineyard to assure the quality of work and the\ntreatment of workers by the contractor. Check your state\u201fs department of labor and the\ncontractor\u201fs references to make certain that the contractor is properly licensed and bonded.\nNurseries and farms growing other crops are possible sources of labor. During their down\nseason you might be able to hire workers. The federal government also runs a seasonal migrant\nworker program called H2A that has been successfully used by some of the larger vineyards in\nthe East.

To plant my vineyard at Barboursville, I employed workers on an H2A visa program. For\nour 140 acres we now employ 13 H2A and 4 permanent workers who come from Mexico and El\nSalvador.

This is the person who will lift the daily burdens of management from the owner\u201fs\nshoulders, so he or she had better be the right person for the job. Most people who decide on a\ncareer in the wine industry choose to work in the Western states. It\u201fs the oddball who elects to\nwork in the cold, humid and wet conditions of the East. However, as the industry grows and\nmatures it will attract more and better managers and workers to our region.\nA good vineyard manager should have excellent communication, problem solving,\norganizational and leadership skills, significant experience growing the style of wine that is your\ngoal, and preferably some formal education in the biological sciences, including plant science\nand/or horticulture. The truth in our industry is that most vineyard managers have little formal\nviticulture education and are graduates of the School of Hard Knocks. Some of them may be\noutstanding and others barely competent. Fortunately, undergraduate viticulture programs at\nCornell University and other land grant universities, along with vocational programs at\ncommunity colleges such as Harrisburg Area Community College, are now feeding trained\nviticulturists into the industry. These graduates are not necessarily better than those from SOHK\nand they will often lack practical experience, but the best of them are fast learners with the\npotential to pick up the necessary management skills. Long Island and the Niagara Peninsula\nhave the greatest concentration of outstanding vineyard managers in the East. Most will have\ncome up through the ranks in the field, but Cornell University, Brock University and Niagara\nCollege are now graduating larger numbers of qualified vineyard managers.\nBudgeting considerations\nLabor will be the greatest expense in the annual operating budget and harvest will always\nbe the most demanding period. In a high-quality vineyard where most of the work is done by\nhand, labor costs can reach 75% of the vineyard\u201fs total operating costs. You would be wise to\nplan realistically for the needs and budget carefully for the costs of skilled labor.\nThere will be other labor-intensive periods in the annual vineyard cycle. Considerable\nhelp will be required at the outset for planting. Afterwards, it is important to know what the\nlabor-intensive tasks are and for when they must be scheduled.

The vine won\u201ft wait, so you\nmust have the necessary crew on hand when they will be needed.\nLabor regulations\nThe least romantic part of farming pertains to regulatory requirements and compliance.\nAgriculture is handled differently from most manufacturing industries. A thorough\nunderstanding of federal, state and local regulations and scrupulous compliance are needed.\nAlmost all of these practices will fall under the umbrella of common sense. But common sense\nand the law are not always the same.\nThe current immigration regulations are political and bureaucratic flypaper and if your\nbusiness has employees it is important to understand your responsibilities, because the\ncompliance standards will increase significantly. The Internal Revenue Service, US Citizens and\n141\nImmigration Service (USCIS), Social Security Administration, Environmental Protection\nAgency, state and federal departments of labor, OSHA and other agencies will all be interested\nin what you are doing. The USCIS (formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service or\nINS) has well-defined rules for the documentation of new employees. The IRS demands a W-4\nform for each employee. The Department of Justice also requires employers to inform them of\nevery new person hired.\nOnce they are hired, all agricultural employees must comply with EPA worker protection\nstandards (WPS) and be offered adequate training. Pesticide education programs at the state\u201fs\ndepartment of agriculture or the college of agricultural sciences at the land grant university will\nhelp farmers to stay in compliance. Detailed pesticide use records may be required by state\nagencies. If a labor contractor is engaged to provide field workers, this person should be\nlicensed and bonded by the state\u201fs department of labor and must provide you with all the\nnecessary documentation.\nIn cases of non-compliance, there is the risk of potentially significant liability and fines.\nLearn what the laws are and follow them to the letter. The compliance chapter in Oregon\nViticulture provides a good overview of this complicated, but necessary part of the vineyard\nbusiness. There are companies such as the Farm Employers Labor Service (FELS) that\nspecialize in agricultural compliance issues.\n142\nChapter 19\nPost-Planting Vine Care\nYou have the vines in the ground and now you can breathe a sigh of relief.

This will be the first test of applied\nviticulture and you want to shoot for an A+.\nFirst considerations\nThe first year is all about establishing a strong and healthy root system for the vines.\nThis means encouraging plenty of foliage to feed the roots. Young vines are more susceptible to\njust about everything compared to older vines, such as disease, insects, weed competition,\ndrought, mechanical damage, neglect, etc. Care in the first year, and especially right after\nplanting, is important to get the vines off to a good start. Vines that are stressed early in life may\nnever perform as well as healthy ones, so there are long-term benefits to early primary care.\nAs with every phase in the development of the vineyard, it is crucial to understand what\nyou need to do, how to do it, and the tools that you will require. A prudent grower also knows\nwhat to expect. In other words: Be prepared. And preparation must begin well before the new\nvines are planted. A good deal of farming is purely reactive, but we must strive to be proactive\nin vineyard management, in that an ounce of prevention really is worth a pound of cure. Any\nneed or problem that can be anticipated and headed off before a vine suffers will be good in the\nlong run for quality.\nIf a newly planted vine does not break bud and seems determined not to be alive, pull it\nout and replace it with a new vine. Vine survival must be monitored closely throughout the\nseason and replants dug in as needed. Losses at this time will usually be due to poor nursery\nmaterials. A 2% overage in a nursery material order is normal to cover the need for replants.\n143\nDon\u201ft wait until next spring to replaces \u201cmisses.\u201d If the\nnumber of replants needed exceeds 2% then a\nconversation with the nursery and a request for\nreplacement vines may be warranted. A key long-range\ngoal of every vineyard is to have vines of the same age\nwithin a vineyard or sections of a vineyard. Lack of age\nuniformity within sections may be detrimental to wine\nquality. However, if there is a large-scale failure in the\nnew planting, then the vines, soils, methods and other\npossible problems must all be reviewed before any\nfurther planting is done.\nNovice growers always hope to see an explosion\nof growth in the first year, with vines reaching the trellis\nwires and ready for training.

In fact, a\nsmaller vine may be a harbinger of quality later on.\nFertilizer should be added only if a properly interpreted soil or petiole test or visual\nsymptoms indicate a treatable nutrient deficiency. New clones and rootstocks have demonstrated\na tendency to display unusual leaf symptoms, particularly color, but new vines will often grow\npast these problems. Show restraint when treating what may or may not be a problem in new\nvineyards. The advice of an experienced grower can be helpful in this situation.\nScouting the vineyard should become routine; it must begin as soon as the first vines are\nplanted and should last for the life of the vineyard. There will be no shortage of challenges to the\nsuccessful establishment of healthy vines. New growers should familiarize themselves with the\nmany threats that menace their vineyard. These are often divided into biotic and abiotic\ncategories. Biotic problems for new vines are caused by disease, insects, and other critters like\ndeer and rabbits. Abiotic threats include plant nutrition, chemically-induced problems\n(herbicides taken up by the vine or damage to foliage caused by improper spraying), tractor\nblight, etc. The list is a long one and the better you understand each threat, the more prepared\nyou will be when it strikes. It is important that you detect problems early and react quickly. The\nexperienced eye of a consultant or fellow grower may help significantly during this period just\nafter the vines have been planted.\nWater\nWhile moderate stress may be desirable for mature vines to produce good grapes, all\nforms of stress should be avoided in newly planted vines. The vine establishment period is a\nparticularly important time to avoid water stress, as it can severely hamper the growth of new\nvines. Indeed, in a drought year irrigation may be necessary. While the East often receives\nsummer rains, there can be lengthy periods of dry weather. You should be prepared for this and\nNewly planted vineyard on the North Fork of\nLong Island\n144\nhave water ready. Be familiar with the visible symptoms of water stress such as yellowing\nleaves, shortened tendrils with burnt tips, short internodes and a smallish, tight shoot tip.\nInstruments such as tensiometers, gypsum blocks, and the monitors included with climate data\nloggers can measure soil moisture and help predict the onset of water stress.\nA vine will always appreciate a drink after the shock of planting. New vines will be\nhighly susceptible to heat spikes, i.e. sharp increases in temperature. Water can be applied prior\nto a heat spike to keep new vines well hydrated. Water should be applied as soon as possible\nafter visual symptoms of water stress are detected. In California new vines are typically watered\nwith twice a week with three gallons of water in each set. However, if you are counting on using\na drip system, some careful planning will be necessary to coordinate its installation.

If drip irrigation is not available\nimmediately after planting in the first year, be ready with a water delivery system for eventual\ndry spells.\nVine nutrition\nAs a general rule, if soil fertility tests indicate adequate nutrient levels and the vines show\nno symptoms of deficiency, then they can be left alone to grow through the first year without the\naddition of fertilizer. Later in the growing season, new vines may display symptoms of\nmagnesium, potassium or (sometimes) boron deficiency, which will often be related to weather\nconditions and soil moisture. Usually these do not pose a serious threat to the vine. Some\ngrowers use a triple-8 or triple-16 fertilizer blend of nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium on new\nvines to help get them started, but more as insurance than out of any real need.\nDepending on soil texture and drainage, the amount of actual nitrogen applied to new\nvines should range from 10-20 pounds of actual nitrogen per acre, but great care should be taken\nnot to burn the roots and/or leaves with too much nitrogen. Excess nitrogen may also encourage\nexcessive first-year growth; long internodes make training difficult and thick (bull) canes can be\nmore susceptible to winter injury.\nNew growers sometimes think that unless their vine displays tremendous growth in the\nsummer it is in need of something, but you should remember that the goal is modest growth and\na moderate-sized vine. When a vine grows vigorously and reaches the fruit wire or beyond, it is\nreflecting the excessive potential of the soil. Any application of fertilizer to new vines must be\ndone judiciously and carefully. If drip irrigation is in place, fertigation through the drip system is\na good method. If applied by hand, fertilizer should be carefully measured and spread in a 6-12\u201d\nradius around the trunk of each plant, and never directly at the base of a vine.\nTrunk diseases (viruses, fungi, insects)\nIn this age of new clone and rootstock selections, young vines may display abnormal leaf\nsymptoms whose exact cause is hard to determine. Viruses, and a host of other trunk diseases,\nhave plagued the nursery materials used by Eastern vineyards. Young vine decline encompasses\n145\na galaxy of vine maladies, including different trunk pathogenic\nfungi, winter injury, viruses, insects (such as the grape root borer)\nand other phenomenon that can severely affect the health of new\nand older vines.

Syrah disorder, which affects\nthe graft union, has become a significant problem in California\nrecently and is now being seen in Eastern vineyards. Growers\nneed to be aware of these problems and must remain vigilant after\nplanting. Most of all, they should strive to purchase clean and\nhealthy plant materials.\nUsing certified vine materials will reduce, but not eliminate\nthe risk of these problems in the vineyard. Vague symptoms in new vines should not necessarily\nbe cause for alarm as they may disappear over time. Growers should learn about more serious\nthreats, such as leafroll virus, and have consultants and testing procedures ready to identify and\nreact to any problems as quickly as possible. Colored tape is a simple but practical tool that can\nbe used to mark vines for follow-up visits or inspection, and growers should always carry a roll\nin their pocket. Any vines that do not appear normal can be flagged and noted, and then\nmonitored throughout the growing season. These flags should remain attached for possible\nspring replanting.\nIntegrated disease and pest management\nLots of living things like to eat vines, from organisms you can barely see to big ones with\nfour legs. Disease, insect, and pest control measures all need to be in place before the vines are\nplanted. If you consider what rabbits, deer and other vertebrate animals can do to the leaves on a\nfreshly planted vine, then you will understand why a deer fence and grow tubes, which offer\nsome protection from browsing animals, may be well worth the investment.\nOne of the key insect pests for new vines is the Japanese beetle. These usually appear in\nearly to mid-July and their feeding can significantly reduce the leaf area. Be ready with a\nstrategy to do battle with these copper-colored foes. Insecticides are an effective tool, but must\nbe used correctly and safely. Follow the instructions on the label, and do not overuse any\nproduct. Pesticides should be targeted directly at the pest or at the vine parts that require\nprotection or treatment. Target organisms are capable of developing resistance to fungicide and\ninsecticide materials that will render the product ineffective over time. It is therefore important\nto rotate between different active ingredients in order to avoid or delay the onset of resistance,\nand only apply pesticides when they are needed.\nIt is strongly recommended that as a grower you get a pesticide applicator\u201fs license. State\ndepartments of agriculture have programs for commercial and private applicators (users of\npesticides). Some of the more toxic materials are restricted and can only be purchased and\napplied by licensed applicators. It is necessary to pass an exam to obtain a pesticide license and\nthis must be updated with continuing education, often obtainable through cooperative extension\nCrown gall on a newly planted\ngrapevine plant\n146\ncourses.

Get to know your extension\neducators, and specialists in plant pathology, entomology and other areas of concern. Become\nacquainted with the most common fungal diseases, especially powdery mildew and downy\nmildew, which can damage leaves or cause them to drop from the vines. New vines should be\nsprayed with the proper materials on a regular basis following recommendations from a reliable\nsource. Losing leaves prematurely to mildew or insects will compromise a new vine\u201fs health and\ncold hardiness during the winter.\nApplying pesticides to new vines can be done using commercial sprayers or backpack\nsprayers depending on the size of the vineyard. Grow tubes may hamper effective coverage of\nleaves and should be removed prior to application. Application rates are harder to determine for\na backpack sprayer, but correct calibration for all pesticides is necessary to avoid inflicting\ndamage on vines as well as the environment.\nIn the case of pesticides and fertilizers, the notion that \u201cmore is better\u201d rarely applies and\ncan do more harm than good. It is absolutely vital that farmers follow the recommendations on\nthe label for all chemical products, regarding safety, handling, mixing and application\ninstructions. You should supplement this knowledge with information gathered from viticulture,\nplant pathology, entomology, and other extension and science-based resources, as well as from\nvendors, publications and fellow growers. You should understand what a pesticide is designed\nfor, how it works, and how to use it properly and safely. A tremendous amount of development\nand testing work is done with each product before it finds its way to the market, but the margin\nof error between proper and improper use may be quite small. When in doubt, do research and\nask.\nThere are excellent information resources available on the Internet. For pesticides, the\nNew York and Pennsylvania Pest Management Guidelines for Grapes is updated each spring and\nshould serve as the basis for an effective and sustainable integrated pest management program.\nMany state extension services publish a grape disease and pest management guide for their\ngrowers.\nRemember that proper scouting is the key to the control of all diseases and pests.\nKnowledge of the foe will enhance the grower\u201fs ability to defeat it with minimal impact on the\nvines, fruit quality, and the environment.\nWeed control\nThis topic has already been discussed, but its importance cannot be sufficiently\nemphasized. In a warm, humid and rainy summer climate, weeds can thrive and quickly take\nover a vineyard. There is probably no greater single problem in Year 1 viticulture than weeds\nthat get out of control and compete with new vines for water, sunlight and nutrients. This\ncompetition, especially in a dry year, can hamper development \u2013 especially of the roots \u2013 and\n147\nprevent the vine from growing to its full potential. It will slow down root development and may,\nat worst, affect a vine\u201fs health and productivity up to the entire life of the vine.

In the short term\nweeds can delay the vineyard from achieving its first full crop, which would represent a serious\neconomic setback.\nWell before planting, a specific and realistic plan of attack (based on the amount of\nweeds present and efforts to control them prior to planting) should be prepared to deal with the\nproblem after the vines are in the ground. Get the necessary manpower and equipment (from\nhand hoes to mechanical grape hoes, herbicides and sprayers) ready before the vines are planted.\nJust because a field has been cultivated and looks to be free of weeds does not mean they\nwill not reappear. Weed control is almost always more work, in terms of time, manpower and\nequipment, than new growers anticipate. If you are using a mechanical cultivator, make sure that\nvines are aligned to the center of their row and that new shoots are protected from the blade and\nsensor arm by either a grow tube or a steel training stake. It would be a good idea to do a little\npracticing with the grape hoe if you are a novice to gain experience and become comfortable\noperating it.\nTalk to growers who have weed-free\nvineyards and find out how they gained control.\nWhile no grower likes using herbicides, they\nwill probably be needed in new vineyard\ndevelopment, both before and after the vines are\nplanted. An approach that combines the\napplication of chemicals and mechanical tillage\nworks well in our region. Select the proper\nequipment \u2013 you will need a dedicated herbicide\nsprayer with the right sized pump and nozzles\nand the correct tillage implement. Weed\nBadgers are too large and cumbersome for our\nsmall vineyards and do not work well in rock\nand on sidehills. Grape hoes made by Braun,\nClemens or Rienieri are the most common. The\nnature of the soil and topography will of course impact the effectiveness of any mechanical\ntillage implement. Give this problem careful consideration and consult other growers for the\nbest methods and equipment.\nHand hoeing is very effective but strenuous and not practical for large vineyards. If\nweeds are out of control, it takes a lot of labor to fix the problem. It may be necessary to follow\nup mechanical hoeing with a hand pass near the base of the vine. A stout and sharp hoe will\nmake the job easier and faster.\nYou will have to learn about the different herbicides available \u2013 including pre-emergence\nand post-emergence and contact vs. systemic herbicides \u2013 and their proper application. There are\neven specific herbicides and legal application rates for new vineyards (defined as less than three\nyears old). Mechanical and chemical weed control can be a definite challenge with both tender,\nlow shoots and weeds growing in the same area.

Some \u201cother\u201d plants are\nnow acceptable in this new visual aesthetic of what a well-managed vineyard should look like.\nGrapes are generally grown in monoculture, which in the midst of complex ecologies can lead to\nproblems with disease, insects and other plant pathogens. Floor management practices may help\nto increase bio-diversity on the farm and enhance, for example, the presence of beneficial\ninsects. There is an excellent vineyard floor management guide available from DCNR in\nCalifornia (see information resources list).\nCover crops\nWeed control should form part of a\nbroader vineyard floor management strategy\nthat includes the use of cover crops, soil\nmanagement, erosion control and other\nmeasures. Some growers plant a cover crop\nafter the field has been cleared and before\nthe vines have been planted, either an annual\ngrass or an orchard/vineyard blend of annual\nand permanent grasses. Others clean\ncultivate with a disc or harrow so that\nvegetation will not compete with the new\nvines. In the Eastern U.S. frequent summer\nrains can cause erosion and limit access to a\nclean tilled vineyard, and under these\nconditions cover crops in Year 1, if\nestablished in time, can be beneficial, especially if irrigation is available to assist the vines in the\nevent of a drought period. In late September or October before or after vines are planted a cover\ncrop, often an annual grass, can be established to hold the soil through the winter.\nOne word of caution: in new vineyards care must be taken that the cover crop does not\nout-compete young vines for water and nutrients, especially if a dry summer follows planting. If\ndrip irrigation is available, a cover crop can be installed in the spring, but it is more likely that\nthe vineyard will have to wait for a fall cover crop.\nEventually a permanent cover crop can be installed. If irrigation is available, a cover\ncrop can be installed right away. If the new vines are dry farmed, a cover crop is usually planted\nin the second or third year (a winter cover is used to hold the soil). These are often low, slowgrowing grasses, such as fine fescues, which have a dense root mass that can choke out broadleaf\nweeds and do not have to be mowed quite as often as a bluegrass or ryegrass. Covers should be\ncarefully selected for their performance characteristics and viticultural benefits such as vigor\nreduction, erosion control or green manure. Recent research in Virginia and North Carolina has\nWild flowers as part of a cover crop mix at Black Ankle\nVineyard in Maryland\n149\ndemonstrated the remarkable ability of cover crops to influence vine vigor. Cover crops also\nreduce soil compaction and help with air and water penetration into the soil.\nFor the best results, cover crops should be planted using a seed drill of correct width\napplied to a proper seed bed at the right time of year. The advice of experienced fellow growers\nand seed vendors is always helpful.

The advice of experienced fellow growers\nand seed vendors is always helpful. Apply the maximum recommended rate of seed for good\nestablishment. The secret is to seed very heavily with an annual orchard/vineyard grass like rye\nthat will establish quickly, and a perennial such as creeping red fescue that will fill in over time.\nMulching\nLive grass or cover crop in the vine row directly under the vines is not recommended\nsince, even if mowed, the crop will compete too strongly for water and nutrients with the young\nvines. Mulching vines is not a common practice in the East, but is known to be effective in\nsuppressing weeds, preserving soil moisture and, when the vines are more mature, potentially\nhastening ripening and reducing the incidence of disease. There are many types of mulch that can\nbe applied to the vine row. Plastic is then laid with a special device, usually directly over the\nvines (holes are cut during the process). The plastic will work well for 2 to 3 years and then fall\napart, after which it must be disposed of in a landfill. This technique is very effective in\nchecking weed growth.\nSynthetic and organic mulches are often used in mature vineyards as a way of controlling\nweeds and pushing grape maturity, but mixed results have been reported and it can be expensive.\nIf not correctly prepared, organic mulches or compost may introduce weed seeds into the\nvineyard and attract rodents such as mice and voles that can girdle young vines. Organic\nmulches will also have an effect on soil nutrients, a factor that should be carefully considered.\nDepending on its composition and amounts, mulch may boost vine vigor beyond desirable levels.\nIt can also impact soil nutrients such as potassium and magnesium. Recent trials with shredded\npaper products have shown some good results in reducing vine vigor and diseases.\nGrow tubes\nGrow tubes involve some extra work\nbut are extremely beneficial, first and\nforemost because they protect leaf tissue\nfrom herbicides. However, they must be\ninstalled correctly, with the base buried in\nthe soil, or else a \u201cchimney effect\u201d could be\ncreated, causing herbicides to be sucked into\nthe tube when they are applied. The warmer,\nhumid, CO2-rich environment inside the tube\nencourages the vine to grow more rapidly,\nalthough once the tip emerges the growth\nrate will be same as that of vines not\ngrowing in tubes. The tube also assists the\ntraining process by guiding the vine straight\nupwards, and will keep rabbits and other\nsmall animals away from new shoots.\nGrow tubes on newly planted vines\n150\nGrowth tubes do have some disadvantages. They promote shoots with long internodes\nthat may not harden off properly before the winter chill arrives; they add to the difficulty of\napplying spray materials; and there are extra costs involved in the material and labor needed to\ninstall and remove them. Long internodes can make proper vine training more difficult. Vines\nin tubes are also more susceptible to heat spikes and the leaves can burn, especially if sulfur has\nbeen applied recently. In fact, if extreme heat is forecasted the tubes should be lifted out of the\nsoil to allow air to enter the base of the tube and circulate around the leaf tissue within the tube.\nLong internodes and", "doc_id": "2c95c058-f031-4ea2-9c60-0d7d6cac9b14", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "adcf8976b3229687d3dff14bcddb9624aebf35470828c8b67e358f6d59a46194", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 657076, "end": 660984}, "relationships": {"1": "acd3b8f9-6274-4b01-8706-eb3b89775b72", "2": "b1b4fe9b-0cc8-4dc6-b142-71f04331dc28", "3": "332c3eb0-1a8a-4c82-922b-d77dfb8cab4d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "332c3eb0-1a8a-4c82-922b-d77dfb8cab4d": {"__data__": {"text": "animals away from new shoots.\nGrow tubes on newly planted vines\n150\nGrowth tubes do have some disadvantages.

In fact, if extreme heat is forecasted the tubes should be lifted out of the\nsoil to allow air to enter the base of the tube and circulate around the leaf tissue within the tube.\nLong internodes and \u201cbull\u201d canes should be avoided in early vine training. Bull canes\noften harden off late and are at increased risk of winter injury, which will interfere with the\ntraining process and overall schedule. The tubes need to be removed from all vines by early\nSeptember. Prior to their removal, in mid-August the tubes should be lifted above the soil just a\nfew inches to allow the leaves and shoot to acclimate to summer temperatures. Complete\nremoval without acclimation can result in vine shock and some premature leaf drop. Removing\nthe tubes by mid-September at the latest should allow the new vines to mature for the winter.\nThis is a critical step in the development of a new vineyard and should not be delayed. An\nalternative to grow tubes are containers such as milk cartons, which do not come up as high as\ntubes and therefore will not force the vines to grow as much. The resulting shorter internodes\nmay be better for early training, and the cartons offer some protection from herbicides and\nrabbits.\nSoil treatment\nPost-planting soil treatment can be important. The soil gets very beat up during the\ndevelopment process with so many tractor passes over the field. The top few centimeters of soil\nbecome severely pulverized and can form a hard, impenetrable layer over the surface of the\nvineyard. A compost dressing on the soil surface will help to restore the soil structure.\nVine structure and training\nThe vines are in the ground and the quest to achieve balance, uniformity, synchronicity\nand harmony must now begin. You have done the best to interpret the site and determine what to\nexpect, but now the vines will reveal their own truth. The reality of the terroir will expose itself\ngradually; it cannot happen overnight. Hopefully all of the decisions regarding variety, clone,\nrootstock, spacing, trellis, etc. will prove themselves to be correct.\nThe main goal of early vine training is to provide as much leaf area as possible to develop\na strong and healthy root system, but some degree of uncertainty about how to train the young\nvines in their first year of growth will be inevitable. The decision depends in part on the relative\nvigor of the vine, which will be determined by soil capacity and other environmental conditions.\nAssuming that water and nutrients are in adequate supply, it may be possible to establish the\nrudiments of a permanent vine structure as early as the first year. Growth, however, can vary\ngreatly depending on conditions around a vine or within areas of a field. Most growers feel\nhappy and confident when they see an explosion of growth in the first year. In truth this may not\nbe the most desirable result. It could indicate a high capacity soil that will cause problems with\nvine vigor for years to come.\nEven at this early stage of vine establishment, working towards a balance between soil\ncapacity, the vigor of the vine (and its rootstock), and growing conditions this summer should be\n151\nthe goal. According to the French, a vine that has been trained in its youth to be small to\nmedium in size is much more likely to retain those size and balance characteristics.

Therefore,\nyou are looking for restrained growth in a healthy vine, with 4-6 shoots, moderately spaced\ninternodes and a modest shoot diameter. Training for proper internode length is especially\nimportant for vines that will be cordon-trained and spur pruned.\nIf a new vine is pruned to one shoot, that single shoot will probably be very vigorous and\nmay not offer the best wood for overwintering or training in the second year. Also, a new vine\nwith a single shoot is much more at risk from deer, rabbits, herbicides, wind and other threats\nthat may damage the shoot and, with no other shoot available to replace it, the training process\nwill be set back a year. On sites with lower vine vigor, the traditional \u201cbush\u201d method of simply\nletting all the shoots grow will help the root system to develop.\nIn their eagerness to see their first crop and an economic return on their investment,\ngrowers may be tempted to push the vine to establish its form in the first year, but this is almost\nalways a mistake. Stressing a vine in its youth may negatively affect its long-term health and\ncause the expression of latent viruses such as crown gall and Petri disease. The primary goal in\nYear 1 is to develop the vine\u201fs root system, which will be young and immature coming out of the\nnursery, and to establish a firm connection between the roots and their new environment.\nA trellis system should be installed for proper vine training. The timing of this can be\ntricky, especially if laser or machine planting is done and the field must be open. Shortly after\nplanting, the trellis must be installed with at least the fruiting wire (and drip irrigation wire, if\nneeded). Training stakes can then be put in place and the shoots gently trained up them using\neither tying tape or grow tubes. It is important to keep the vines from sprawling over the ground,\nwhere they could be run over by tractor tires, are more susceptible to disease, and cannot be\neasily sprayed. To make sure that the vines can expand and grow, use good quality, flexible\ntraining tape, not stiff ag tyes or twist-ties.\nIf growth is modest, 4 to 6 shoots can be retained and loosely tied to the stake. This will\nbe your one and only chance to get a straight trunk. The reasons for wanting a straight trunk are\ninnumerable and yet many growers fail in this critical task. As more and more vineyard\noperations and tools are mechanized, from grape hoes to harvesters, a straight trunk is vital for\noptimal equipment performance. Plus \u2013 it just looks a lot better.\nThe question of how many trunks to train on a new vine is one every grower needs to ask\nand, like so many viticulture decisions in the East, the answer will depend on an assessment of\nthe risks of the climate and the tolerance of the vine. The trunk number will generally be\ndecided on the basis of the risks and potential severity of winter injury. In Virginia and points\nsouth, growers often leave only one trunk. Around the Finger Lakes and Ontario, two trunks are\nnormal. Winter injury is a surprisingly random phenomenon and it is impossible to predict\nwhether one or both trunks might be damaged or lost.

Multiple trunks have greater management requirements (e.g. training, suckers, etc.),\noffer more surface area for potential overwintering disease organisms, and are not as neat in\nappearance as single trunks, but there can be no doubt about the advantages they offer when it\ncomes to winter injury.\nTry to avoid the syndrome known as the \u201chome vineyard\u201d effect. It is understandable\nthat the block of vines closest to the owner\u201fs home or the winery entrance will be particularly\n152\nwell cared for since it will help to form a visitor\u201fs first impressions. As vines get further from the\nmain gate they tend to show more signs of neglect. Every effort should be made to farm a\nvineyard uniformly over its entire area so that distant blocks do not become the neglected\nstepchildren of the property.\nPreparing for winter\nPreparing a vine for winter in cold regions begins during the growing season. In most\ncases you should remove all fruit clusters during the summer of the first year. It is not necessary\nto remove the jklaterals. By the end of August shoots should be \u201chardening off\u201d or lignifying\ninto woody tissue. If they are not, then the vine is growing too vigorously and may not mature\nproperly before the first deep freeze event. This could lead to tissue injury. Encourage vines to\nharden off by withholding or limiting water and applying no nutrients later in the season.\nProtecting the graft unions of young\nvines in cold regions is important. In a\npractice called \u201chilling up\u201d, the lower part of\nthe vines is buried under soil to provide\ninsulation against the cold. Then, even if a\nsevere freeze occurs, the scion may not be\ncompletely killed and suckers can be used to\nretrain the vine. This is not a great scenario,\nof course, but it is one that growers in cold\nregion must accept. Hilling up requires a\nskilled operator using a special tool to push a\nmound of soil over the base of each vine. It\nis time-consuming and the soil must be in the\nright condition, usually after harvest and\nbefore the first hard freeze, to complete the\ntask effectively. If you do not have the weed problem under control, it will be even more\ndifficult. Textbooks do not explain how to hill up and take down in spring, so the best way is to\nlearn from an experienced grower. The job is decidedly more challenging on hilly terrain\n(especially side hills) and in rocky soils. You must decide for yourself whether it will be worth\nthe time and expense given the climate conditions. Once again, risk tolerance must be factored\ninto the equation. You should consider the cost of grafted vines, the labor to replant and the loss\nof uniformity in the vineyard in making the decision.\nA winter or permanent cover crop should be seeded in the late summer or early fall to\nmake sure that it gets established before winter sets in.

Wine production is mostly NOT about what you read\nin the pages of the Wine Spectator or The Wine Advocate. While it is far from the job of this\nmanual to tell people what to believe, we would like to underline that it is the responsibility of\nevery wine grower to produce high-quality wine that will benefit the wider wine industry as well\nas his or her own vineyard, and to do it in the most sustainable way possible. Assuming that as a\nnew grower you can immediately adopt organic or biodynamic practices may be dangerous to the\nhealth of your new vines and the quality of the wines.\nYou should study what sustainable agriculture systems and practices are out there and\nhow you might incorporate them into your vineyard operations. A planet that is under increasing\nenvironmental duress needs less intrusive agriculture. When America was an agrarian society,\nsustainability was inherent in the country\u201fs way of life, but in an age of petrochemicals we are\noffered more choices with greater benefits but also higher costs.

As a novice grower you may\nthink that one of your choices is not to use pesticides. The truth is that a grape grown using\n\u201eorganic methods\u201f does not necessarily mean a grape that was grown without pesticides, nor does\nit automatically make a better wine, nor can you assume that it is more environmentally friendly.\nThere was a (very) novice grower on Long Island who proudly delivered some Chardonnay\ncovered with powdery mildew to a winery, convinced that his grapes were special just because\nthey had been grown organically. Of course there was no hope of making good wine from his\ndiseased fruit.\nFrankly, there are better ways to save the environment than growing wine. However, like\nmost activities, growing wine is not an \u201ceither-or\u201d proposition. If blending is an important\ntechnique for making fine wine in the cellar, the practice of compromise extends to the vineyard\nas well. A dogmatic attitude against the use of synthetic pesticides, herbicides and so on will\nseverely limit your options and lessen the chances of a successful vintage. The truth is that you\nare trying to grow wine in a high-risk context dictated by less than favorable growing conditions.\nThere is much less uncertainty in the arid climates of Chile and California and therefore low\ninput practices are more likely to succeed there.\nOrganic and biodynamic methods of wine growing are not systems-based; instead they\nrely on empirical skills and experience and try to use materials that will have the least possible\nimpact on the ecosystem. It takes an intimate knowledge of your vineyard, as well as great\nintuition, skill and experience, to grow wine organically, particularly in the challenging\ncontinental climate of the East. If you stop to consider who is successfully farming with\nbiodynamic methods in Burgundy, Alsace, Austria or the Rhone Valley (wine areas with\nconditions similar to the East), generally the greatest names in wine like Zind-Humbrecht and\nLeflaive are mentioned. The truth is, they would probably make the best wines no matter what\nsystem of viticulture they used. Maybe you will be the same league as these folks someday, but\nyou have to pay your dues to get there. Not every grower can attain their level of skill and\ncompetence, which would give them a chance to succeed using alternative practices. The\nbeginner should begin farming with conventional methods fully integrated into a sustainable\n155\nphilosophy, with the goal of producing the best quality grapes given the conditions of the\nvintage. As you gain more experience and intuition about your site and vineyard, you can use\nmore sustainable or even organic practices and materials. In many cases, simply doing a better\njob of calibrating your sprayer, using a tracked vehicle instead of wheels, or timing your sprays\nbetter to reduce your applications from ten to eight may have greater benefits in terms of the\nenvironment than other more visible and more dramatic methods.\nThere is no question of course that every grape grower should try to farm as sustainably\nas possible given the conditions in his or her region.

Every grape\ngrower should strive to satisfy the requirements of sustainable viticulture in his or her region.\nKeep in mind though that it is pointless to be overly dogmatic in winemaking, as in any other\nendeavor. If you choose to introduce organic practices, do so for the right reasons and make\ncertain that you acquire the necessary know-how first. Always study all of your options and\nmake the best choice for your site, abilities and goals. Never forget that your goal is to make the\nbest wine possible.\nThe 2010 Production Guide for Organic Grapes from Cornell Cooperative Extension is\nan excellent current source of information for grape growers. While the recommendations are\ndesigned for native grape production, they can be carefully applied to hybrid and vinifera wine\ngrape production. Black rot is still the Achilles Heel of organic vinifera wine grape production.\nUntil this disease can be solved in commercial vineyards, the widespread adoption of organic\npractices will be difficult. However, in dry years, like 2007 and 2010, practices can shift towards\nmore sustainable, even organic for the best wine growers.\n156\nChapter 21\nContinuing Education: Becoming a Lifelong Learner\nIf you survive your first year, you can begin to feel confident about your ability to run a\nvineyard. It will be helpful nevertheless to get an impartial assessment of the quality of the\nvineyard so that you know what was done well and what could be improved. Your knowledge\ngap is closing, but there is still probably a sizeable chasm. Here is where your consultant may\ncontinue to play a valuable role, heading into Year Two. Ask yourself whether you are actually\ncapable of developing a sound integrated pest management program on your own, do you know\nhow to calibrate a sprayer, can you properly train a vine, do you have a plan for vineyard floor\nmanagement and irrigation, can you create a nutrient management plan, etc.? If you don\u201ft know\nhow to do any one of these things, then you need to learn. This is the lifelong learning side to\nthe wine business. The winter after planting is a good time to stop, assess what you have done,\nand determine what you still need to do and learn.\nMany new grape growers do not have agricultural backgrounds and are not aware of their\nlocal cooperative extension service. It is part the National Institute for Food and Agriculture\nwithin the U.S. Department of Agriculture and has met the needs of agriculture and communities\nacross the nation since 1888. Cooperative extension is usually attached to the college of\nagricultural sciences of a state\u201fs land grant university. It provides an interface between the\nacademic expertise and research facilities of the college and the community and industries which\nit is its mission to help.\nExtension educators (formerly called agents) divide their time between the field and the\nlab. If a grower has a problem in the vineyard, a viticulture or horticulture educator is often the\nfirst to respond to a call for help. If the educator does not know the answer, then he or she may\ntake the question to a specialist in, for example, plant pathology or entomology (insects). If the\nproblem is more complex, such as the recent arrival of late season rot organisms in vineyards, a\nresearch project can be set up to find the explanation or solution.

Some consultants specialize in areas such as disease control, soils or vine\nnutrition. As a vineyard matures, it is always a good idea to have someone new come in to\nprovide an objective evaluation of your vines and practices. A vineyard is not a static system,\nand viticulture as a discipline is always moving forward, so getting another perspective will\nalways add to wine quality.\nIt also bears repeating that industry associations and fellow grape growers can be great\nsources of information. Remember that the most valuable experience is local experience, and a\nneighboring grower will very likely understand the situation in your vineyard immediately.\nIndustry associations exist to provide information and education for members and they should be\nenthusiastically supported. They also do the tedious but necessary work of advocacy for the\nwine industry in the state capitol, departments of agriculture, tourism and others, the governor\u201fs\noffice, land grant universities and all the other partners who are critical to the growth and success\nof the wine industry. Remember that your vineyard does not exist in a vacuum. You form part\nof a larger community of wine growers and you should actively participate in its initiatives. If\nyou are not doing your share, then someone else is doing it for you. Attend industry association\nmeetings and pay your dues. Find out how you can help.\nIt is not absolutely necessary to understand and appreciate wine to be a good wine\ngrower, but it certainly helps. The term \u201ewine grower\u201f denotes a specific and highly qualified\nprofession.

See the\ninformation resources list for some recommended viticulture educational resources.\nViticultural knowledge is constantly growing and evolving. The best wine growers keep\nup to date on the latest ideas and technologies, always on the lookout for what may work in the\nvineyard to improve fruit and wine quality.\n158\nChapter 22\nThe Good Grower\nWhat defines a good wine grower? There are certain qualities that can be found in the\nbest growers from Pennsylvania to Chile and from South Australia to France. In Europe\nviticulture is highly empirical, based on generations of experience and tested each day in the\nvineyard and cellar. Growers at the best vineyards are highly intuitive in their practices,\nknowing by sight, sounds,touch, and smell what to do or what will happen in the vineyard.\nLucie Morton can teach about balanced pruning and reel off the numbers, but in the field she\nprefers to look at each individual vine and prune it based on her sense of its needs and to obtain\nthe correct size, shape and balance. This skill can only be developed over the course of many\nyears. Sherlock Holmes rebuked his friend Watson once, saying, \u201cYou see but you do not\nobserve.\u201d This all too often true of wine growers as well, but you should strive to do better.\nWhat do you observe when you are in the vineyard? What does it tell you about the condition of\nthe vine? Jim Law has often reminded me that we should be asking \u201ewhy\u201f and not just doing\nthings by the book or calendar: Why is this happening? Why am I doing that (e.g., putting on\nfertilizer, spraying a particular chemical, ripping the soil, etc.)? Asking why requires you to\nobserve and think before taking effective and meaningful action. Keeping an open mind and not\nbeing subject to dogma, whether the most ingrained tradition or the latest viticultural fad, allows\nthe grower to examine all of the possibilities and make the best choices for the vineyard. \u201cTruth\nbut verify\u201d connects the vineyard system and agriculture to science, which attempts to explain\nwhat we observe or guide us in our practices. But science will never explain every phenomenon\nin the vineyard. The willingness to experiment, try something new, test an idea and push the\nquality envelope on any vineyard site will often reap a reward of understanding or even new\nknowledge. The best growers are naturally curious. They know how to balance science and\ntechnology with their own sense of how to create a vineyard ecology that is harmony.\nHere are a few examples of good growers. What makes them so successful?\nJan Waltz of Waltz Vineyard, Manheim, PA Brad Knapp at Pinnacle Ridge Vineyard in Kutztown, PA\n159\nRutger de Vink (RdV), Jeff Newton (CVCA) and Jim\nLaw (Linden)\nEric Miller and Brett Mihalsik from Chaddsford Winery\nJoanne Levengood at Manatawny Creek balance\npruning vines\nCarl Helrich at Allegro Vineyards\nTony Vietri at Va La Vineyards John Santos, Hazlitt 1852 on Seneca Lake\n160\nThe best wine growers are constantly trying to learn more, and they understand that their\ncommitment to the vineyard is for the long-term.

They know their limitations but are always\npushing forward to see what is possible. The process of observing and then adapting to changing\nconditions, whether in the vineyard or the market, is a never-ending one. Great wine growers are\na truly unique breed, combining the qualities of the scientist, the engineer, the botanist, the\nbusinessman, and the dreamer. But above all they are outstanding farmers, and proud of it.\nKnowing that they must always strive to do better, they are patient, creative, passionate and\nendlessly curious. They are glad to share ideas and help others. Jan Waltz noted that learning is\na process where you have to \u201cListen, learn, observe, test and implement.\u201d This entails borrowing\ngood ideas from different sources, distilling them to their useful components, choosing some for\ntesting, and then adopting those that are most suited to your vineyard. The moment you stop\ndoing this, quality ceases to improve. If you believe that you have reached the pinnacle,\nsomeone will soon be surpassing you.\nThe best growers have a deep and abiding appreciation and understanding of wine, its\nhistory, evolution, and quality. You should constantly and critically taste wines to gain an\nunderstanding of benchmarks in the wine world. You should evaluate wines with people who\nhave a more skilled palate than yours; this is the best way to learn. Taste wines made from your\nown grapes, but also your neighbors\u201f wines, and regional, domestic and international wines that\nwill improve your palate and give you a clearer vision of the viticulture and wine making needed\nto achieve benchmark quality.\nThe good grower enjoys being part of many communities and expresses this by being an\nexemplary steward of the land and sharing the fruits of his labor. There is nothing more heartwarming than the camaraderie that exists in the wine industry. You, as a wine grower, can go to\nany corner of the globe where wine is made and find kindred souls eager to welcome you into\ntheir midst, places where \u2013 as at home \u2013 it\u201fs all about good food, good company, and a passion\nfor making great wine. That is why I have been in this business for almost 30 years.\nThere is no formula for growing great wine. Your site will have its own ingredients and\nmethods. There are important principles and practices that act as beacons along the path but it is\nup to the good grower to discern the fine detail that will lead to a great wine.\nGood luck and remember that what you are doing is for the joy of making and enjoying\nfine wine!\nLucie Morton and Nelson Stewart at Karamoor Farm\nVineyard\nEd Boyce and Jean-Philippe Roby at\nBlack Ankle Vineyard in Maryland\n161\n Chapter 23\nIn Vino Veritas: Some Thoughts Concerning the Winery\nIt is really true: the truth is in the wine.

This is the other side of the fine wine equation and deserves your attention. Even\nthough it will be two or three years before you produce enough fruit to make meaningful\nquantities of wine, it isn\u201ft too soon to start thinking about the destination of your fruit once it\ncomes off the vine.\nIn cool to cold viticultural regions wine making, like grape growing, is more demanding\nbecause there are simply more challenges such as unripe or diseased fruit, late rains, frost, etc.\nUnderstanding the wine making process will allow you to relate to and communicate better with\nthe wine maker. The vineyard and the cellar are linked as by an umbilical cord and nothing\nhappens to one that does not have an impact on the other. Appreciating what happens to the\ngrapes after you deliver them to the crush pad \u2013 from the de-stemmer to wine store shelf \u2013 will\nadd richness and satisfaction to your work as a grower. It will also greatly improve your\nrelationship with the winery.\nOne thing you will have to accept is that in some years great fruit just won\u201ft happen. In a\ndifficult vintage you can do everything humanly possible, but the fruit will not be fully ripe or\nmay have disease problems or the harvest numbers just won\u201ft balance out. These are called\n\u201cWine Maker Years\u201d when you hand over sub-standard fruit and say, \u201cI did the best I could.\nGood luck.\u201d What results can a clever and creative winemaker extract from this fruit? It takes a\nperson with special skills and the right tools to transform mediocre fruit into good wine. On the\nother hand, in the great vintages it is up to the wine maker not to mess up what you have\nachieved in the vineyard. These are the years that make conscientious wine makers the most\nnervous. In the East, the wine maker is as critical a contributor to fine wine as the grower, in\nsome years even more important.\nThere are some very simple principles that should be kept in mind when it comes to the\nart of making wine:\nA great wine maker is able to achieve the right balance in his or her wines in both good\nand poor vintages, understands Eastern fruit and growing conditions, understands and\nrespects the vineyard and the grower, shares the same stylistic goals, and has some\nnotions of viticulture.

Give your\ngrapes the best possible chance to go the distance and be transformed into a fine wine.\n163\nWinemaking in the Eastern U.S.\nRich Olsen-Harbich, Wine Maker\nRaphael Vineyards\nPeconic, New York\nAchieving quality and balance in red wines in the East first requires exceptional management in the\nvineyard and a dedication to producing quality over quantity. The variety of red grapes grown in a particular\nvineyard site should fit the ripening parameters for its terroir. In order to achieve these goals, a sufficient number of\nfrost-free days need to be available for the red wine in question. Realistic expectations of the variety should match\nwhat the site can produce. For example, ripe Cabernet Sauvignon would be difficult to achieve in many\nnortheastern vineyard sites due to the late ripening character of this grape. If you can have frost-free ripening\nconditions into November on a regular basis, then complete maturity of this variety is do-able. If not, go for earlier\nripening red varieties such as Pinot or Merlot. Of course, the minimum winter temperature of the site must also\ncome first and foremost.\nI think there can also be a lot done in the northeast with varieties like Norton, Zweigelt, Lemberger and\nNoiret \u2013 the last one as a blending grape. In my opinion, the variety is less important than the quality and style of\nthe red wine that can be produced in a given location. If the best and ripest red fruit you can grow is from\nChambourcin, then that's the variety you should focus on, and try to make the best possible wine you can from it.\nThe variety will change depending on the terroir \u2013 that's what makes the northeast so interesting as well as\nchallenging. Having accurate historical weather data is also essential for growers who are just starting out.\nAmong the Bordeaux reds, Malbec is by far the earliest ripening. However, this variety is also the most\ntender of the Bordeaux reds, requiring prime vineyard sites in order to survive. Pinot Noir is one of the earliest\nripening of the noble varieties; however, it has been preceded by a reputation as a difficult grape to ripen and vinify.\nCabernet Franc is one of the hardiest reds grown in the northeast, but again it is late and requires rigorous fruit\nthinning and a lot of patience in the fall. Once you've established the variety that will do the best on your site, you'll\nneed to implement solid vineyard management in order to bring the fruit to the winery in the best possible condition.\nA good management program for all growing seasons in the northeast needs to include the following:\n\u2013 Good disease and insect management to ensure a healthy canopy through to the end of the season\n\u2013 Shoot thinning to open up the canopy to light and air\n\u2013 Rigorous fruit thinning to insure adequate ripeness in any given season.

Winemaking...\nWinemaking in the Eastern U.S.\nRich Olsen-Harbich, Wine Maker\nBedell Vineyards\nPeconic, New York\nAchieving quality and balance in red wines in the East first requires exceptional management in the vineyard\nand a dedication to producing quality over quantity. The variety of red grapes grown in a particular vineyard site\nshould fit the ripening parameters for its terroir. In order to achieve these goals, a sufficient number of frost-free days\nneed to be available for the red wine in question. Realistic expectations of the variety should match what the site can\nproduce. For example, ripe Cabernet Sauvignon would be difficult to achieve in many northeastern vineyard sites due\nto the late ripening character of this grape. If you can have frost-free ripening conditions into November on a regular\nbasis, then complete maturity of this variety is do-able. If not, go for earlier ripening red varieties such as Pinot or\nMerlot. Of course, the minimum winter temperature of the site must also come first and foremost.\nI think there can also be a lot done in the northeast with varieties like Norton, Zweigelt, Lemberger and\nNoiret \u2013 the last one as a blending grape. In my opinion, the variety is less important than the quality and style of the\nred wine that can be produced in a given location. If the best and ripest red fruit you can grow is from Chambourcin,\nthen that's the variety you should focus on, and try to make the best possible wine you can from it. The variety will\nchange depending on the terroir \u2013 that's what makes the northeast so interesting as well as challenging. Having\naccurate historical weather data is also essential for growers who are just starting out.\nAmong the Bordeaux reds, Malbec is by far the earliest ripening. However, this variety is also the most\ntender of the Bordeaux reds, requiring prime vineyard sites in order to survive.

Winemaking\u2026\nMy main goal in any vintage is to harvest Bordeaux reds with ripe berry flavors and zero tolerance for any\ngreen or unripe character. This requires a long hang time for the fruit. As we have a serious bird problem, our vines\nneed to be netted in order to achieve this required hang time. Beginning at veraison (in mid- to late August) and\nuntil harvest at the end of October through early November, the fruit is covered by netting. Hand harvesting is also\nessential when working with the best fruit. We hand harvest and also sort at the winery in order to make certain that\nwe have only pure fruit going into the tanks. In my view, for small vineyards in the northeast hand harvesting is\nanother important factor in producing high quality red wines.\nMy harvest parameters involve little in the way of scientific analysis; they are instead based on tasting the\nfruit and visual inspection. I pay absolutely no attention to the pH of the fruit at harvest, as I feel that this parameter\nis given too much importance and can lead to under-ripe fruit at harvest. Higher pHs in the range of 3.5 and above\nare nothing to be afraid of, and in my opinion it is more important to have ripe flavors, low acid and mouth-filling\ntannins.

It is\nreally just intellectual candy and does not fit into the category of \u201csaving the world.\u201d But wine\nhas been a part of human civilization for 9000 years and so it must have some importance to us.\nThe challenge of growing a great grape is irresistible and a lot of fun. I can honestly say that\nafter almost 30 years in the wine business, I am never bored. There is always so much to learn\nand we have so much further to go.\nWine growing is the synthesis of so many interesting disciplines: science, art and craft,\nagriculture, business, marketing, psychology, ecology and more for the production of a complex\nbeverage. It is a careful blend of tradition and modern science and technology. It has been\ninteresting to observe over the past two decades how New World wine regions like New\nZealand, Chile, California and Oregon closed the quality gap with the Europeans so quickly\nusing technology as their propellant. But at some point, the best producers realized that\ntechnology alone cannot craft a great wine. It was necessary to incorporate the wisdom of\ncenturies of experience to find the best balance point for a wine. Old World wine regions\nembraced technology, only to discover that it was not the answer to their dreams but that the best\nwines resulted from a blended production method. As I travel the wine world, it is remarkable to\nsee the similarities in ideas, methods, and technologies. Those who take a global view of their\nwine making are often the most successful. Many of the ideas and inspiration that make a great\nwine in the Medoc are also hard at work in Oakville. Yet, it is the subtle differences in terroir\nthat make the Cabernet Sauvignon so unique to each region.\nI am constantly amazed by the diversity, passion and determination of the people in the\nwine industry. Often with little or no agricultural training, most manage to develop very\ncompetent vineyards, some outstanding.

Quality is the most important goal for all wines regardless of type, style or price point.\n2. Quality, price, and your investment in time and money will often be highly correlated.\n3. Start small and grow gradually into a vineyard, as you learn and succeed.\n4. The other option is to start big, but make certain that you heed every item in this list.\n5. Have a plan and think ahead.\n6. Keeping things simple is almost always better. Do not over-design or over-build.\n7. Taking short cuts or skimping on the quality of materials and installation will almost\nalways cost you more in time, expense and aggravation in the end.\n8. Organization, planning and attention to detail will pay quality dividends in the fruit. Do\neverything WAY ahead of time (Jan Waltz).\n9. PLEASE, do not reinvent the wheel. This has all been done before. Get good advice and\nlisten to it!\nIn a wet climate such as that of the Eastern U.S., here is what to look for if your goal is highquality wine production:\n10. An exceptional vineyard site. Look for one that is well drained to excessively well\ndrained (TAW 2.5-4.5).\n11. Areas with rain shadows or low precipitation.\n12. The correct match between climate and grape variety.\n13. Low to moderate soil fertility (especially nitrogen), cation exchange capacity, pH, and\norganic matter.\n14. Slope \u2013 the steeper the better (up to 30%) and south facing.\n15. If possible, a NE-SW row orientation.\n16. Aim for small to medium size vine, high-density viticulture, i.e. > 2000 vines/acre and\nlimited yield per vine.\n17. Evaluate and design for optimal vine size and balance, and earlier fruit maturity.\n18. Low vigor rootstock \u2013 RG, SQR, 101-14, 420A (in some cases)\n19. The very highest quality plant materials.

There are various measure that you can resort to when conditions require it, such as cover\ncrops, root restriction, root pruning, drain tile, French drains, vigor diversion canes and\ncrop, drastic hedging. These are only band-aids applied ad hoc to compensate for site\ndeficiencies, but can help in difficult vintages.\n24. Farming is all about problem solving. If you are not good at this, you probably will not\nbe a good farmer.\n25. Wine growing is highly specialized farming, with the goal of producing fine wines.\n26. Fill in your knowledge and experience gap, and then keep on learning!\n27. Taste benchmark wines critically and with tasters with more skilled palates than yours.\n28. Travel to other vineyards far and wide. Observe, learn, test and implement.\n29. With regard to points 23 and 24, always ask, \u201cHow did they do it?\u201d Then find out in\ndetail exactly how.\n30. Be passionate about your vines and wines.\n31. Share and participate in the efforts of fellow wine makers and the industry.\n32. Have fun and don\u201ft ever forget why you are doing this. One grower told me that he\u201fll\nnever work another day in his life. He has found fulfillment in the vineyard.\n168\nSelected Reference Resources for Winegrowers\nThe Wine Grape Production Guide for Eastern North America\n(2008), edited by Dr. Tony Wolf at Virginia Tech, is a technical\nproduction partner to this practical manual and is highly\nrecommended along with the following viticulture resources:\nCreasy, G. and Creasy, L.
